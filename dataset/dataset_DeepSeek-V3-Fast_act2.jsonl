Playing 'Storm' (a POWER) will generate Lightning orbs passively each turn, increasing our damage output. This is better than playing Strikes (low damage) or Auto-Shields (we already have 5 Block). Coolheaded+ is too expensive (2 energy) and doesn't synergize as well with our current orb setup. Storm helps scale our damage against this Elite fight.\"\n}\n```"}]}
