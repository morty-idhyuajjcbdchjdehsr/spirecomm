The core strategy revolves around scaling **Searing Blow+3** as the primary damage source, supported by Carnage+ for burst. Use **Entrench + Second Wind** for strong block turns, and **Dual Wield** to multiply key cards (e.g., Searing Blow). **Combust** provides passive AoE, while **Feed** helps sustain.  \n\n**Weaknesses:** Relies heavily on Searing Blow; lacks consistent card draw and energy generation. Prioritize upgrades on Searing Blow and remove Strikes/Defends to streamline the deck. Play defensively until Searing Blow can one-shot enemies.        \n\ncombat situation:\n        **Floor**: 18, \n        **Turn Number**: 4, \n        **Current HP**: 53/80,\n        **Block**: 13,\n        **Energy Available**: 1,\n        **Relics**:[ Burning Blood, Neow's Lament, Incense Burner, Membership Card, Sundial, Runic Dome ],\n        **Enemy Lists**:[ \n\tShelled Parasite( 3/68 ,Intent.NONE,0,[ Plated Armor(8), Vulnerable(1),  ]) \n\t],\n        **Draw Pile**: [ Strike, Defend, Defend, Strike, Entrench, Second Wind, Defend, Bash, Searing Blow+3, Carnage+ ],\n        **Discard Pile**:[ Shrug It Off, Defend, Strike, Strike, Strike ],\n        **Player Status**:[ Combust(5), Intangible(1) ]\n        **Potion**:[ Ancient Potion(False), EssenceOfSteel(False), LiquidMemories(False) ]\n        **Orbs**(if you are DEFECT): [  ]\n        \nPrevious actions in this turn:\n[{ turn:4,operation:choose card 'Shrug It Off' }\n{ turn:4,operation:choose card 'Defend' }\n{ turn:4,operation:choose card 'Strike' towards 'Shelled Parasite(target_index=0)' }\n{ turn:4,operation:choose card 'Strike' towards 'Shelled Parasite(target_index=0)' }\n{ turn:4,operation:choose card 'Strike' towards 'Shelled Parasite(target_index=0)' }\n]\n\nLast Thought:\nEven though Strike will only deal 6 damage (9 - 3 from Plated Armor), it's better to use the remaining energy to chip away at the enemy's HP rather than waste it. The enemy is Vulnerable, so the damage is slightly more effective. Since I have Intangible(1) to block any potential attack, I can safely play Strike now to maximize damage output and cycle the deck faster for Searing Blow+3 next turn.\n\nNotice:\nYou have the Runic Dome relic, which provides energy each turn but prevents you from seeing enemy intents.
