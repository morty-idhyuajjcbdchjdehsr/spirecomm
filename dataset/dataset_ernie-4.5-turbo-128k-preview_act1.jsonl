The core strategy revolves around using **Doom and Gloom** for AoE damage and **Dualcast** for burst single-target damage. **Zap** provides consistent Lightning orbs for channeling.  \n\n**Strengths:** Solid AoE with Doom and Gloom, decent burst via Dualcast, and basic defense.  \n**Weaknesses:** Lacks scaling, card draw, and energy generation. Strikes/Defends are inefficient.  \n\n**Game Plan:**  \n- Prioritize upgrading **Dualcast** or **Doom and Gloom**.  \n- Use **Doom and Gloom** for groups, **Dualcast** for elites/bosses.  \n- Remove Strikes/Defends for better cards (e.g., **Ball Lightning**, **Coolheaded**).  \n- Seek energy relics or focus orbs for scaling.        \n\ncombat situation:\n        **Floor**: 4, \n        **Turn Number**: 2, \n        **Current HP**: 60/75,\n        **Block**: 0,\n        **Energy Available**: 0,\n        **Relics**:[ Runic Pyramid ],\n        **Enemy Lists**:[ \n\tCultist( 35/51 ,Intent.ATTACK 6*1,0,[ Ritual(3),  ]) \n\t],\n        **Draw Pile**: [ Defend, Defend, Strike ],\n        **Discard Pile**:[ Dualcast, Strike, Barrage, Doom and Gloom, Zap ],\n        **Player Status**:[  ]\n        **Potion**:[ PotionOfCapacity(False) ]\n        **Orbs**(if you are DEFECT): [ Dark, Lightning, Orb Slot ]\n        \nPrevious actions in this turn:\n[{ turn:2,operation:choose card 'Doom and Gloom' }\n{ turn:2,operation:choose card 'Zap' }\n]\n\nNotice:\nYou are facing enemy Cultist,who gains Strength after each turn,so it iscrucial to eliminating it quickly.  \n\nHand Pile:\n[ Recursion(1,False,SKILL), Defend(1,False,SKILL), Strike(1,True,ATTACK), Strike(1,True,ATTACK), Defend(1,False,SKILL) ]\n\nnow give the response.\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "```json\n{\n\t\"action\": \"end\",\n\t\"cardIndex\": -1,\n\t\"potionIndex\": -1,\n\t\"targetIndex\": -1,\n\t\"explanation\": \"I made an error in my previous response by selecting a card that costs 1 energy when I have 0 energy available.
