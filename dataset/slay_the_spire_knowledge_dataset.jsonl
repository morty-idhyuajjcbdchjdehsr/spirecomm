It was located in the game's files as a sprite of a robotic-looking blue robot, similar in design to the Cultist.\n\nFans of the game theorized it would be the third character since it was found, as it seemed to fit the colour order of \"red/green/blue\" that already existed with the Ironclad and the Silent. Crowbot was theorized by the community to have mechanical abilities, a colour scheme of blue, and a large number of powers.\n\nIn an interview with one of the developers, Crowbot was confirmed to have been the planned third character. It was supposed to have a \"mana\" system to play cards instead of an energy system. During testing, the idea fell flat and the character was scrapped. The developers then began on a \"gunner\" character which eventually led to the Defect.\n\nAfterwards, the third Character The Defect was added into the game's Beta branch in an update on April 26, 2018."}]}
{"conversations": [{"role": "user", "content": "What knowledge is there about 'Defect' in Slay the Spire?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The Defect is one of four playable characters in Slay the Spire. Once among the like of Orb Walkers and Bronze Automaton as one of many ancient automatons, it has since gained sentience and seeks its way out of the Spire. It attacks foes with a high-tech arsenal, array of Powers, and elemental evocations.\nThe Defect has a unique mechanic, the Orbs. Using cards and Relics, The Defect Channels these elemental spheres into a set of Orb slots, activating their passive effects each turn or Evoking them for a one-time burst. The Defect starts with three Orb slots, though cards and relics can add or consume them. It starts with 75 hp.\n\nThe Defect's starting Relic is  Cracked Core, which Channels 1 Lightning at the start of each combat.\n\nIt was added to the beta build in Weekly Patch 22: Testing the Third Character during the early access. It was released to the public, along with the game and other two characters on January 23rd, 2019.\n\n\n【Cards[]】\n\n\n【Starting Deck[]】\n\n- 4 Strike\n- 4 Defend\n- 1 Zap\n- 1 Dualcast\n\n\n【Gameplay[]】\n\n\n【Orbs[]】\n\nThe Defect begins with three Orb slots and considers the rightmost Orb to be the 'next' Orb to Evoke. Channelling an Orb inserts it into the rightmost empty slot. If every slot is full, each Orb will be shifted one slot to the right, popping the right-most Orb out of its slot and Evoking it. The Defect can have a maximum of 10 Orb slots.\n\nLightning,  Frost and  Dark orbs have a passive effect that activates at the end of the Defect's turn, from right to left, or oldest to newest. The passive effect of  Plasma activates at the start of the Defect's turn. While these effects are initially weak, The Defect can increase  Focus and channel additional copies to sharply increase their potency.\n\n\n【Focus[]】\n\nFocus is a stat unique to The Defect that affects Orbs the same way  Strength affects Attacks and  Dexterity affects  Block. Increasing  Focus increases the magnitude of both the passive and Evoke effects of each Orb (except for  Plasma). It is possible to reduce Orb effects to 0 by decreasing  Focus.\n\n\n【Relics[]】\n\nThe Defect has fewer class-specific relics than the other classes, having only one class-specific rare relic rather than three (like the Ironclad and Silent) or two (like the Watcher). The Watcher has equally few overall, but instead of being short two Rare relics is short one Rare and one Boss relic.\n\nUncommon Relics:  Gold-Plated Cables,  Symbiotic Virus\n\nBoss Relics:  Frozen Core (replaces  Cracked Core),  Inserter,  Nuclear Battery\n\n\n【Strategy[]】\n\nThe Defect's game plan almost always involves implementing a long-term plan each battle. By developing Orbs, Powers, and cards with escalating effects, the Defect sets up an insurmountable late-game position and then destroys its enemies with its accumulated advantage. This is a radically different style from the Silent and the Ironclad, who tend to apply bursts of damage to take enemies out opportunistically.\n\nAs a consequence, the Defect struggles to win with a deck full of \"good stuff\". While it does have access to some individually strong cards, they don't present the sheer power that the other characters enjoy without support. However, due to the long-term nature of its best strategies, the Defect must sometimes take such individually strong cards, either to survive the first few acts or to provide frontloaded solutions while it sets up.\n\nJuggling deckbuilding decisions between these two extremes of short-term benefit v.s. long-term power is thus an ongoing struggle during every Defect run, yet a rewarding one once all of the pieces fall into place.\n\nThe Defect also has a higher number of chance-based effects, like Hello World, Chaos, and Creative AI.\n\nThe Defect's strongly synergistic cards encourage some powerful and well-supported archetypes. Identifying and focusing on one is a key aspect of the Defect strategy.\n\n\n【Build types[]】\n\nListed below are the standard synergies that Defect decks build towards, which may give you an idea of direction for your own runs. Some important things to keep in mind:\n\n- Most of these builds aren't mutually exclusive. Think of each of the archetypes listed below as an engine that you can incorporate into your deck; depending on the situation, you are more than able to adapt or combine multiple of them.\n- It's important to not \"force\" a particular build from the outset of the game. Build your deck to solve your immediate problems first and foremost, then allow an archetype to come to you organically. The only exception would be if you run into cards or relics in the early-game that are both individually impactful and form the crux of an entire archetype, and such situations are few and far between.\n\n- FocusStacking: While Defect's orbs are initially weak, they grow in power significantly once it findsFocus-increasing cards for its Deck. After this, the Defect's game plan shifts to playing all of them as quickly as possible, then becoming incredibly powerful in terms of offense and defense. Generally, the Defect wants a mix of different kinds of orbs; in particular, you should be able to consistently generateLightningandFrost, changing between them to suit the situation at hand.Cards or relics that increaseFocus:Data Diskgives +1 Focus for free, helping you significantly at the start of a battle.Defragmentis your bread-and-butter, and are priority upgrades.Biased Cognitionprovides a large burst of Focus which can help you end hallway fights quickly. Its downside can be negated withOrange Pelletsor blocked by your ownArtifact. Combo this withCore SurgeorClockwork Souvenirto gain permanent Focus with no drawback.Consumeis a more situational Focus gain card as it reduces your orb slots, but it is reusable as it is a Skill and not a Power. It is best if you have theInserterto offset its downside.Cards that generateLightningandFrost:Zap(Zap+ is 0 cost)Ball LightningElectrodynamicsis a very high-impact card against multiple enemies and is generally the Defect's main AoE solve.Cold SnapGlacierCoolheadedprovides card draw while channeling Frost, allowing you to dig for your main cards.Other helpful additions:Capacitorand relics such asInserterandRunic Capacitorgive you more Orb slots to benefit from Focus increasing Orb value.Seeklets you pull your Focus-generating cards immediately out of the Deck.Card draw such asSkimandCompile Drivercan help cycle through your Deck to get Focus into play as soon as possible, especially when combined withEnergygenerators.Fissionis the best of both worlds, providing both card draw and Energy!Force Fieldcan help generateBlockin a pinch.Echo Formcan duplicate yourDefragmentswhich can normally only be played once, or give you multiple Orb casts.Chaos+ can give you a large volume of orbs right away, but be wary of leaving orb generation up to chance against elites or bosses...\n\n- FrostTurtle: While runningLightning-only is a risky prospect,Frost-only builds are surprisingly consistent and can thrive even against the true final boss. \nOnce the shields are up, the Defect can devote every Energy to damage while the opposition cannot do anything back to it.Frost Turtle builds requireFocusand orb slot buffs to function. Refer to the Focus Stacking section for more information on these cards and relics.Cards that generateFrostincludeCold Snap,Glacier, andCoolheaded.Cards and relics that generateFocusincludeDefragment,Biased Cognition,Consume, andData Disk.Cards and relics that add orb slots includeCapacitor,Inserter, andRunic Capacitor.Your main priority as you approach endgame should be to find a damage solution for the final bosses, as defense alone might not win you the run.Barrageis one of your best options in this slot-based deck.Blizzardmay seem tempting, but it scales up very slowly, and takes a long time to match Barrage's power. It is still a viable option if you need spread damage.Combine this build withDarkOrb-generating cards and let them build up behind your Frost orbs, unleashing them when the time is right.Other tips and useful additions:Calipersis a run-winning addition to this deck. The Defect will often have leftoverBlockwith a full setup, which this relic allows to snowball out of control.For orb slots, 2 copies ofCapacitorshould suffice, but you can take more if you want.Take as manyDefragmentas possible, and upgrade as many of them as you can. Focus is even more crucial for this deck as 1 Focus means 1 additionalBlockper channeled Frost orb.SinceCapacitorandDefragmentare not expensive,Mummified Handhas an even greater chance to allow multiple free cards to be played.TheFrozen Coreboss relic fills your orb slots with Frost orbs, which can help you more quickly establish your defenses.Runic Domeis also a powerful boss relic for this Deck, as the extra energy helps get everything into play. You will generally not care about the enemy's action once set up.\n\n- LightningSpam: This aggressive build tries to channel and Evoke as manyLightningOrbs as possible, beating enemies down eight damage at a time. Unlike other Orb builds, smaller is better - one Orb slot is optimal to facilitate Evoking.Key cards to this build:Cards that generateLightningincludeZap,Ball Lightning, andElectrodynamics.Electrodynamics is a keySeekorBottled Tornadotarget, letting you start fights against multiple enemies with a massive advantage.If you have a large number of powers,Stormcan add value to those plays by generating even more Lightning.Bullseyebecomes significantly stronger when you're constantly evoking Lightning in the target's direction, amplifying all that damage.Consumedecreases the number of orb slots while increasing Focus. With fewer orb slots, you can rapidly Evoke multiple Lightning Orbs for a large amount of damage.Static Dischargeturns the enemy's offense against them, channeling massive amounts of Lightning against multi-hits in particular.As you are willingly inviting damage to end fights, one or two copies ofSelf Repairare recommended to keep the Defect's health at safe levels.Thunder StrikeandTempestare this deck's premier finishers, dumping huge volumes of damage onto the enemy.Energygeneration from cards likeAggregate,TURBO, orDouble Energythus helps this build quite a bit.Other considerations:Have aBlockplan in mind, as you will gain much less value fromFrostif you are constantly Evoking everything. For example, if you are supportingTempestwith Energy generators, you can useReinforced Bodyas well to defend yourself from huge hits.This build benefits greatly from damage mitigation relics such asToriiorTungsten Rod, especially in conjunction withStatic Discharge. When combined, they can completely nullify damage from almost all multi-hits.\n\n- DarkOrb Engine: Even though the trickyDarkOrbs aren't as well-supported as the others and don't always fit into typical builds, the satisfaction of Evoking a highly charged Dark Orb twice (or more!) makes it all worthwhile to try.Cards and relics that generate Dark Orbs:Darknessis your mainDarkOrb generator. When upgraded, it powers up all Dark Orbs in play by one charge.Doom and Gloomis a solid spread damage option that happens to generate a Dark Orb. This card is what usually fits into a normal build as an early-game option, but gets to shine a lot more here.Symbiotic Virusgenerates a free Dark Orb at the start of each combat.Key parts of a Dark Orb engine:Recursionis arguably the most important card for Dark Orbs. This is because if you Evoke a Dark Orb with Recursion, it will immediately channel again with the same stats. If you have a Dark Orb in front but don't want to give it up quite yet, Recursion will move it to the back while dealing a huge chunk of damage in the process, letting you continue building its power.DualcastandMulti-Castwill unleash the Dark Orb multiple times onto enemies, usually ending the fight with a sufficient charge.If running Multi-Cast, you will want to support it withEnergygenerating cards likeAggregate,TURBO, orDouble Energy.Other considerations:Keep in mind that the Dark orb will target the lowest health enemy.This engine works well withFrostdecks, as Frost Orbs help generateBlockand allow you to stall the fight until you are ready to Evoke a Dark Orb.Be extremely careful when fighting enemies with the ability to gainIntangible(namelyNemesis), as evoking a Dark orb at the wrong time will result in the target taking only 1 damage and the accumulated charges being wasted as a result.\n\n- Zero Cost: The Defect has a high number of strong 0-cost cards, as well as unique supporting cards likeScrapeandAll for Oneand efficient card-draw Skills. Drown an enemy underFTLs,Claws, andBeam Cells. It's sort of like the Silent'sShivbuilds, but way more back-loaded and visually impressive.Damage comes from 0-cost cards that do damage:ClawFTLBeam CellGo for the EyesStreamline- requires 2 plays (of 2- and 1-cost respectively) before it reaches 0 cost.Dualcast+Zap+The Deck then also needs a lot of recycle/card-draw effects to get as many of the 0-cost cards in play per turn. The Defect has a lot of great support cards for this type of deck:All for One- the best one for this deck as it allows you to re-play all of your 0-cost cards you've played in your deck up until that pointRebound- allows you to double-play cards likeStreamlineandClawto more quickly ramp up their effects.Hologram- reuseAll for One, double-playStreamline, or replay a 0-cost card.Scrape- good card draw that let's you immediately play any 0-cost cards it finds.White Noise+ - when upgraded it becomes a free power.Reboot- very good if you already have the core engine of your deck in place.Seek- great for findingClaw, or even better,All for One.There are also some extremely useful neutral cards that either help get 0-cost cards, or are 0-cost cards themselves (or both):Madness- can be difficult to get, but if you are able to acquire it, it will greatly speed up your deck by turning your strongest cards into 0-cost cards.2Madness+ withAll for OneandHologram+ is an infinite. Use both madness to reduceAll for OneandHologram+ to 0-cost, and use each one to put the other back into your hand.Seek+ makes this easier to pull off. Double Seek+ is even easier, as it allows for 3 of the 4 cards to be put into your hand immediately.Bottled Lightningalso makes this easier to pull off.Swift StrikeSecret Technique+/Secret Weapon+ - both of these when upgraded will allow you to get your key cards faster.Panache- as you will almost certainly be playing more than 5 cards every turn, this will be a guaranteed 10 damage to all enemies every turn.Thinking Ahead- upgrade this ASAP so that you can reuse it.ViolenceMetamorphosisPurity- can get rid of Strikes/Defends during combat, which, depending on the state of your deck, may allow you to go infinite.J.A.X.- a rare card as it only comes from theAugmenterevent, but any source of strength is a huge benefit for a deck that aims to play many 0-cost attacks every turn. As an added bonus, the card itself costs 0 and so, if you have the health for it, can quickly ramp up your damage to high levels in this deck.\n\n- Power Spam: The Ironclad likes Attacks, the Silent loves Skills, and the Defect completes the cycle with its affinity for Powers. Grab high-impact powers likeEcho Form, pick up someForce Fields, stack powerful effects, and bury the opposition under your cumulative advantage. While most Defect builds pick and choose the most appropriate Powers for their deck, this one will eventually have the benefits of them all. There is nothing quite like being able to double your first 6 cards played per turn with 10+Focusand a horde ofLightningorbs staring down any boss that dares stand in your way.Refine the deck by using Powers to fill the roles of Attacks and Skills. ConsiderStatic DischargeandStormyour primary sources of damage, andBufferandSelf Repairyour biggest blockers. A Power spam deck's win condition depends on the particular Powers you acquire. Most builds will create a huge amount ofLightning, but others simply lean onCreative AIand let the buffs snowball out of control.Key cards and relics for this build:Stormallows the deck to maintain offensive presence while setting up. Upgrade it as soon as you identify that your deck is leaning into Power spam.Creative AIallows Power spam decks to scale to infinity without ever losing steam, synergizing amazingly with itself and all of the other Power-synergy cards that The Defect can get.Heatsinksis what makes a Power spam deck tick. It will allow you to blaze through your deck to find key Powers orEnergygeneration likeAggregate,TURBO, orDouble Energy, which is critical to setting up before you take too much damage.Recycle+ can delete useless powers thatCreative AIgenerates, such asHello Worldor extra copies of Creative AI, and helps keep your deck size thin in longer fights.Force Fieldis your mainBlocksupplement; it is essentially guaranteed to be at 0 cost due to how this deck functions.Amplify, while a bit inconsistent, can provide a huge power spike depending on which Power is duplicated. Good targets for Amplify are cards likeDefragmentandCapacitor. If you choose to run it, support it with cards likeHologramandEquilibriumwhich can get it into your hand at the perfect time.Mummified Handis essentially a game-ender in this build. Being able to chain Powers and potentially play your entire hand for free is simply too good to pass up.TheBird-Faced Urnis the perfect relic to recover HP lost while setting up.\n\n- Reprogram: A deck that repeatedly playsReprogramto rapidly scale up yourStrengthandDexterity, ignoringFocusand Orbs entirely. If you find yourself with a conspicuous lack of Focus deep into the run, Reprogram can give your deck a strong win condition. It is important that you do not force a Reprogram deck, as committing to it too early can completely lock you out of half of Defect's card pool.Key cards and relics:Reprogramis the star of the show. Upgrade it as soon as possible, and you'll gain +2StrengthandDexterityevery time you cycle through your deck. You only really need one copy, and cards likeSeekorSkimcan help you get to it faster.A few copies ofHologram+ let you reuseReprogram, repeatedly playSteam Barrierin an emergency, or recover copies of each other, scaling up your Block as needed. Your high Dexterity will easily make up for Hologram's low Block.Echo Formallows you to double-play Reprogram at the start of the turn. Double-playing damage or block cards also compensates for the fact that Defect doesn't have many cards (aside from the unreliableRip and Tear) that scale multiple times with Strength or Dexterity.Hyperbeamdeals massive AoE damage, and you can ignore its only downside.Steam Barrieralso effectively loses its downside, since you'll be gaining Dexterity faster than Steam Barrier loses Block.All for Onestrategies fit well with this deck, since spammable 0-costs likeClawandBeam Cellscale well with high Strength. It can also recover yourSteam Barrier.Plasmagenerators likeFusion+ andNuclear Batteryare good options, since Plasma Orbs don't scale with Focus.Prismatic Shard, while usually unreliable, is a surprisingly good relic to pick up when you have Reprogram. Other characters' damage cards scale much better with Strength and Dexterity, letting you better take advantage of the boosts.Reprogram can also shine in a hybrid build. If you find yourself with lots of Orbs but no Focus, the following cards coupled with Reprogram can help speed your Deck up:Fissionallows you to get one last burst of value out of your Orbs by speeding through your Deck, letting you get Reprogram into circulation or finding your Echo Form earlier to begin the snowballing process.Barrageconditionally scales multiple times with Reprogram's Strength boost. If you have some Plasma generation or still have copies of damage commons such asCold SnaporBall Lightningin your Deck that are generating useless Orbs, consider picking this up to still be able to capitalize on their presence.\n\n- Snecko EyeAbuse: The Defect has incredible synergy with theSnecko Eyedue to the very large pool of high-impact cards it has.The Defect has several extremely powerful but expensive cards likeFusion,Echo Form,Sunder, andMeteor Strike. By takingSnecko Eyeearly enough, you can focus exclusively on taking these cards for absurdly high-value turns. Many of these effects will generate more energy than they spend.In particular,Meteor Strikewill never cost more than 3 Energy, allowing you to always play it. Evoking thePlasmaOrbs it generates can also allow you to play more high-rolled cards, which somewhat negates the drawback of Snecko Eye.All for Oneis completely broken with Snecko Eye. Since cards will retain their cost until you draw them again, it will fetch everything that was decremented to 0 cost, even cards that would normally be quite expensive. A 0-cost All for One paired with a 0-costHologram(which is also a good card in this build for similar reasons) is an easy infinite.Skim,Compile Driver,Coolheaded+, andOverclockcan provide large amounts of card draw, which is a premium in Snecko decks.Most of the Defect's 0-cost cards are dead weight in this archetype, so it is important to home in on it as early as possible. If you don't getSnecko EyefromNeowor the first boss, pick a different strategy.\n\n- 10 Card Infinite: With this build, the defect is capable of going infinite against most opponents.Getting the deck down to 10 cards allows for setting up 4 card infinite cycles withSkimand negative cost cards.Fusion,Meteor Strike,TURBO(withRecycle),Recursion,Dualcastcan combine in various ways to get negative cost.Hologramor a secondSkimcan be used to restart the cycle.Example set:Skim+,Hologram+,Fusion+,Dualcast+. Skim draws Hologram, Fusion and Dual Cast, Fusion and Dual Cast make net 2 energy, Hologram retrieves Skim. Nets 1 energy and 5 block, can substitute any attacks in for Fusion and Dual Cast after energy is built up.2Coolheaded+ andFusion+ can make infinite block, and channel an arbitrary number of Frost orbs forBlizzard.It is important to only take cards that are either Powers, Exhaust, or are directly part of the combo while building the deck, since the goal is to get the total number of cards down under 10. Recycle can handle junk put in the deck and help thin it out if its not quite down to 10 cards.Boot Sequenceis very helpful as a free method of preventing damage during the first turn while the infinite combo is being set up while exhausting itself out of the deck to help enable the combo.\n\n\n【Unlocks[]】\n\nThe Defect itself is unlocked by completing a run with The Silent.\n\n- Unlock Number: 1st, Prizes Unlocked: Rebound,Equilibrium,Echo Form\n- Unlock Number: 2nd, Prizes Unlocked: TURBO,Sunder,Meteor Strike\n- Unlock Number: 3rd, Prizes Unlocked: Hyperbeam,Recycle,Core Surge\n- Unlock Number: 4th, Prizes Unlocked: Gold-Plated Cables,Turnip,Runic Capacitor\n- Unlock Number: 5th, Prizes Unlocked: Data Disk,Symbiotic Virus,Emotion Chip\n\n\n【Gallery[]】"}]}
{"conversations": [{"role": "user", "content": "What knowledge is there about 'Ironclad' in Slay the Spire?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The Ironclad is one of four playable characters in Slay the Spire. He wields an arsenal of powerful strikes, boasts formidable defensive options, and draws fiendish strength from his demonic benefactors to empower himself in various ways. He starts off with 80 hp, highest of the playable characters, and can manipulate Exhaust.\n\nThe Ironclad's starting Relic is  Burning Blood, which heals 6 HP after combat.\n\n\n【Cards[]】\n\n\n【Starting Deck[]】\n\n- 5 Strike\n- 4 Defend\n- 1 Bash\n\n\n【Relics[]】\n\nUncommon Relics:  Paper Phrog,  Self-Forming Clay\n\nRare Relics:  Champion Belt,  Charon's Ashes,  Magic Flower\n\nBoss Relics:  Black Blood (replaces  Burning Blood),  Mark of Pain,  Runic Cube\n\n\n【Strategies[]】\n\n\n【General Build Archetypes[]】\n\nThese are the standard types of decks that may give you an idea of direction for your deck, or what you want to go for. Keep in mind that none of these builds are mutually exclusive. Many of them are more of a general strategy, which can be adapted or combined into multiple builds in a single deck.\n\n- High DefenseDeck: This strategy focuses on building upBlockover multiple turns, potentially eliminating incoming damage.Plated Armoris an excellent fit in this build.Essential cards includeBody Slam,Entrench, andBarricade.Barricademay be substituted byCalipers, provided that you have a consistentBlockper turn.Keep in mind thatBarricade+ costs 2 energy and won't instantly boost your damage/block, so playing it may weaken you on the turn played.Body SlamandJuggernautare excellent sources of damage, which is still important to win.Though not an intuitive choice,Second Windcan be used to thin out extraneousBlockcards once enoughBlockis built up, letting the player more reliably draw attacks and rely onEntrenchto maintain theirBlock.Strengthreduction fromDisarmandWeakfromIntimidate,Clothesline, andUppercutcan help reduce enemies' attack damage, allowing you to maintain yourBlock.\n\n- High StrengthDeck: Spot Weakness,Flex,Limit Break,Demon Form, andInflameare cards that offerStrength.A helpful tip withFlex, in particular, is that if you have anArtifactbefore you useFlex, or trigger the effect ofOrange Pelletsafter usingFlex, you won't lose theStrengthgained from it on the next turn. This givesFlexgood synergy with sources ofArtifacts, such asClockwork SouvenirorPanacea.Limit Breakalso allows you to benefit permanently from temporary strength effects such asFlex.Whirlwind/Heavy Blade,Sword Boomerang,Twin Strike, etc. are all cards that synergize well withStrength.This build focuses on increasingStrengthand multiplying its power through the choice of attacks. Attacks that hit multiple creatures, or hit multiple times scale more effectively withStrength.Reaperbecomes a very powerful healing tool with highStrength, especially when paired with aMagic Flower.Vulnerabilitycards such asBash,Trip, andThunderclapwork very well with the high damaging attacks offered to you with highStrength.IfLimit Breakis upgraded, you can cast it multiple times for exponential strength gain.Headbuttand a small deck size help you cast it more often. Relics and potions that grant some initial strength are very helpful in case you drawLimit Breakwithin the first few turns.\n\n- Searing BlowDeck: UpgradeSearing Blowevery opportunity you can. Its damage increases more with each upgrade, reaching 100+ damage after ten upgrades.Vulnerableis extremely good in aSearing Blowdeck, as when upgraded a lot the extra damage can easily reach 40-50+The deck should be kept small to cycle back toSearing Blowas often as possible.If you decide to go for aSearing Blowdeck, you should always take the path that gives you the most campfiresMost must-upgrade cards become less valuable, as their upgrade is taking away fromSearing Blow'spower.You generally only want to aim for aSearing Blowdeck if you meet the following criteria:You get it early in Act I (preferably before your first campfire)You have a path that can take you through at least 3+ campfires in Act ICard synergies:Headbuttlet you play it an extra time each deck cycleDual Wieldgives you additional copies if you manage to get it in the same hand asSearing Blow.If you getDual Wieldin a Searing Blow deck, you should prioritize cards that help you find the combo:Secret Weapon+ is probably the best one in bringingSearing Blowto your hand.Violenceis also good if your deck is small and you don't have many Attacks remaining.Runic Pyramidwill ensure that you get the combo at some point.All exhaust cards can be very good at thinning your deck during combat.Double Taplet yourSearing Blowdeal double damageArmaments- can continually ramp up yourSearing Blowdamage during combatRelic synergies:Warped Tongswill continually upgrade yourSearing Blowover time during combat.Wing Bootsallows you to take additional campfires that you normally won't be able to get to.Necronomicondoubles the damage ofSearing Blowevery time you play it.Pen Nib- double damage ofSearing Blowbut requires some planning to execute.Paper Phroghas a minor synergy but at higherSearing Blowlevels the increase of damage from this relic is significant.Dolly's Mirror- if you get this after you have upgraded your Searing Blow a few times, it will effectively double the strength of the deck.\n\n- Corruption+Dead BranchDeck: Corruptionmakes all Skills cost 0 in exchange for exhausting them upon use, butDead Branchwould generate a replacement for used skill. IfDead Branchgenerates another Skill, then you can use another Skill again for free.Most of Ironclad Skills grant highBlock, allow you to easily tank damage once you use multiple of them. If possible, useBarricadebeforehand to allowBlockyou've gained not to be wasted between turns.Some of Ironclad Skills grantEnergy. Special notes goes toSeeing Redwhich normally cost 1 un-upgraded. WithCorruption, it becomes a free 2Energygeneration. SpendEnergygained on other crucial cards on your hand, such as Power card or Attacks.Fiend Firecan generate a lot of random cards withDead Branch, which gives more chance to generate random 0-cost Skills cards\n\n- Corruption+Dark EmbraceDeck: Unlike the normalexhaustionand defense strategies above (which focus on building up power over time), your goal here is to try and make your deck almost entirely out of skills, get outCorruptionandDark Embracetogether, then burn through your entire deck in one turn to raise your defense, with doubling effects fromEntrenchplayed last, finally followed by one or moreBody Slamsto kill the enemy in one hit.The essential cards areCorruption,Dark Embrace,Entrench, andBody Slam, plus cards likeImpervious,Shrug It Off, andSentinelto build defense before you double it withEntrench. Provided you keep your deck overwhelmingly tilted towards skills and fill it with lots of card draw, you should only need to drawCorruptionandDark Embracebefore you start comboing off; the rest of the combo will be found as you draw your deck. Multiple copies ofEntrenchorBody Slam(or things that duplicate them) are still extremely valuable; you also want to upgradeCorruption,Dark Embrace, andBody Slamto reduce the cost of the combo so you can deploy it faster.It's also important to have cards that let you dig for your combo, such asShrug It Off,Burning Pact, andOffering. Beyond just letting you dig for your combo, these let you draw past attack cards when comboing off.Hitting your hand maximum is a serious problem, especially if you obtain multiple copies ofDark Embraceor large numbers of card-drawing skill cards.Bloodlettingcan help you play other cards to get them out of your hand and can provide the energy you need to playCorruptionandDark Embraceas soon as possible.Burning Pactallows you to get unwanted cards out of your hands while drawing a large amount. Once the combo is deployed,Sentinelwill both provide additionalBlockand a large amount of free energy to play out the rest of your hand.True Gritcan be used to avoid cards getting clogged in your hand, but it's extremely important to upgrade it to avoid the risk of having it hit your combo pieces.Offeringboth draws you cards and gives you energy to play your non-skills.Double TapandDual Wieldcan amplify the final blow by doubling yourBody Slam, whileSecret Weaponcan dig for yourBody Slam. Do not upgrade yourSecret Weapon, since you want it to beexhaustedsoDark Embracewill let you draw a card off it.Powers that provide persistent benefits to your defense orexhaustionintended to help you over multiple turns or which give you minor benefits forexhaustsandblocksare somewhat less useful to you, since your goal is to combo off in a single turn for overwhelming damage rather than slowly accumulating benefits; but they're still worth collecting, since they give you a backup strategy in case you can't get all your combo pieces or something else goes wrong.Barricadeis particularly useful because it allows you to, if necessary, split your combo over multiple turns, or to accumulateBlockslowly before you finally get everything you need to go off.An alternative but similar strategy is to useJuggernaut,Corruption, andFeel No Pain. Each defensive skill played is worth an additional 10-14 damage.Iron Wavesare good fallbacks.Removals should focus on getting rid of yourStrikesrather than yourDefends; while yourDefendsaren't as good as your otherBlockcards, they can still be cycled through for free once you haveCorruptionandDark Embraceout.\n\n- Perfected StrikeDeck: Perfected Strike+ strike cards (Strike,Pommel Strike,Twin Strike,Wild Strike,Swift Strike).Your deck will become very heavy, lots of draw likeBattle Trancewill be important, as will in-battle upgrade effects likeApotheosis,Armaments+, andWarped Tongs.Powerful defensive cards will be a must when offered, since you will be taking large quantities of offensive cards.You will also need to be on the lookout for strong defensive Relics, such as:Self-Forming Clay,Orichalcum,Anchor,Horn Cleat, orCaptain's Wheel.Necronomiconsynergizes very well withPerfected Strike+.Prayer Wheelworks very well with this deck as it gives you twice as many occasions to add Strike cards.Dual Wieldincreases the power of the deck a lot more than usual, increasing the damage of each Perfected Strike by up to 6, and increasing the amount to be drawn.A 4th energy is particularly important to be able to play multiple copies if desired.\n\n- Status+EvolveDeck: Uses powerful cards with drawbacks that inflictStatuscards, such asWild Strike,Power Through,Reckless ChargeandImmolate, withEvolveto negate the loss of draws.Exhaustcards likeTrue Grit,Sever Soul,Second Wind, andFiend Firecan keep you from becoming overwhelmed in long term fights.Shrug It Offcan giveBlockeven with Dazed fromReckless Charge.Feel No Painalso pairs well with cards that create Dazed, effectively granting you 3-4 block per Dazed card in hand at the end of your turn.True GritandEvolveare your high-priority targets for upgrades, as True Grit+ lets you decide which card to Exhaust, and Evolve+ increases your draws instead of replacing them, greatly speeding up your deck.Mark of Paineffectively loses its downside.With an upgradedEvolve, a 9 cardFiend Firehappens easily.Top it off withFire Breathingfor a nice passive AoE damage. A normal draw full ofStatuscan easily turns into 30-50 damage to ALL enemies. With multiple copies this can easily be your main source of damage.Only run multiple copies ofFire Breathingif you're quickly and consistently getting outEvolve, or you'll only slow your deck down.This build mitigates the power of mostStatusinflicting enemies, and synergizes well with many other deck types.Medical Kitgreatly improves your ability to manage yourStatuscards, improving your performance in long-term fights. It also negates the self-damage fromImmolate.Card draw likeBattle TranceandPommel Strike+ is important for digging through your deck and gettingEvolveset up as soon as possible.\n\n- Masochist Deck: UtilizesRuptureand cards that deal damage to you, aiming to finish fights quickly.Each use ofRuptureincreasesStrengthgained per trigger. You may stack it 2 or 3 times to quicken yourStrengthgrowth.After applyingRupture, useBrutalityorCombust. Their health cost per turn means you would gain 1Strengthevery turn.Unless you want additional card draw or AoE damage, you would not need more than 1 copy of these two, as stacking them increases health loss but notRupture'sStrengthgain.Strengthgain fromRuptureis consistent if built for, but it can be slow.Limit Break+ can help multiplying yourStrengthto finish fights before you lose too much health.Hemokinesis,Offering, andBloodlettingare the other cards that self harm.TheBlue Candleallows you to hurt yourself by exhausting curse cards.Reaperbenefits from theStrengthgain and provides some much needed healing.Necronomiconcan double the healing provided.J.A.X.is a chance encounter, but grants you both health loss to triggerRupturewhile also grants youStrengthon its own.Any cards that benefit fromStrengthgain are good here.Draw to get your combo together is very helpful. Make sure to get somedefenseto keep outside damage taken low.Blood for Blooddoes significant damage and will quickly become cheap or free withBrutalityorCombust. Having a solid 0-cost attack lets you take advantage of the extra cards drawn fromBrutality, and can tide you over if you don't findRuptureearly on (or draw it early in the fight).ThePainCurse card can enable easyRupturescaling. If you obtain aPainin the early game, perhaps even as part ofNeow's blessing, it may be worth building towards a Masochist deck. This can be further empowered withRunic Cube, allowing you to cycle through more cards than usual wheneverPainis in your hand.\n- Masochist Deck: \n\n- Fiend FireDeck: Gather a lot of cards, especially cards with card draw and energy likeBattle Trance.With a lot of cards in your hand useFiend Fireto deal high damage to target.Fiend Firescales very well withStrength.Runic Pyramidcan help you gather a large number of cards.\n\n- DropkickInfinite Deck: GetDropkickand remove as many other cards as possible. Once you have 2Dropkicksor 1Dropkick+Dual Wield, you can playBash+ lnfiniteDropkick. UpgradedOfferingis very useful in this build because it can draw 5 cards, which means that you can infinite kicks with a 10 card deck.This is an easy to assemble but strong build. It can be done with restarting short games to getDropkickearly.\n\n- Snecko EyeDeck: If you manage to getSnecko Eyeduring first Boss fight, you can go for cards with high energy costs as main damage dealer:Bludgeon,CarnageandImmolateare the best, whileSever SoulandFiend Firecan help with clutter.Dual Wieldis what makes this build shine: getting two zero costBludgeonsis usually enough to finish a fight.Defensively it's possible to focus exclusively onFlame Barrier.Going forPerfected Strikebuild is a sound strategy prior to gettingSnecko Eye, since Boss rewards are rather random.\n\n- RampageDeck: Keep the deck small with cards to support yourRampage, preferably upgraded one, and use it repeatedly.A balance between draw power likeBattle Trance,Warcry, etc. and defense is good asRampagecan scale up quickly as main damage source with appropriate support cards,Shrug It Offis a great card as it provide both.Best support card forRampageisDouble Tap, which ram up the power twice, andHeadbuttcan allow you to search forRampageto be used  more frequently.If possible,Vulnerablerelics and cards can be devastating for enemies if combined with a well scaledRampage.Avoid cards that giveStatuslikeWild Strike,Reckless Charge, orImmolate. It can makeRampagebecome inaccessible or less likely to be drawn later in fight, which defeat the purpose of the card. Only take them if you haveEvolve+, and even then just reckless charge unless you haveMedical KitorSecond Windto prevent situations where your hand is full of status cards.Do not useHavocunless you haveFrozen Eye.Unlike in aClawdeck, only 1Rampageshould be taken.\n\n\n【Unlocks[]】\n\n- Unlock Number: 1st, Prizes Unlocked: Heavy Blade,Spot Weakness,Limit Break\n- Unlock Number: 2nd, Prizes Unlocked: Omamori,Prayer Wheel,Shovel\n- Unlock Number: 3rd, Prizes Unlocked: Wild Strike,Evolve,Immolate\n- Unlock Number: 4th, Prizes Unlocked: Havoc,Sentinel,Exhume\n- Unlock Number: 5th, Prizes Unlocked: Blue Candle,Dead Branch,Singing Bowl\n\n\n【Gallery[]】"}]}
{"conversations": [{"role": "user", "content": "What knowledge is there about 'Silent' in Slay the Spire?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The Silent is one of four playable characters in Slay the Spire. She is a huntress themed on a rogue fantasy build. This cunning character weakens her foes with numerous cuts and poison, while using cheap tricks and agility to avoid their attacks. With many powerful cards that draw and discard, the Silent ensures that she will always be one step ahead of her enemy. She starts with a relatively low 70 hp.\n\nThe Silent's starting Relic is  Ring of the Snake, which draws 2 additional cards when starting combat.\n\n\n【Cards[]】\n\n\n【Starting Deck[]】\n\n- 5 Strikes\n- 5 Defends\n- 1 Survivor\n- 1 Neutralize\n\n\n【Relics[]】\n\nStarting Relic:  Ring of the Snake\n\nUncommon Relics:  Ninja Scroll,  Paper Krane\n\nRare Relics:  The Specimen,  Tingsha,  Tough Bandages\n\nBoss Relics:  Hovering Kite,  Ring of the Serpent (replaces  Ring of the Snake),  Wrist Blade\n\n\n【Strategy[]】\n\nThe Silent does not have any reliable ability to heal or gain an abundance of starting health. Therefore, she is often focused on damage mitigation through  Block and  Weak chaining, and gaining explosive advantage to end the encounter at opportune times. Many of her cards draw cards, reduce costs, or give additional Energy, allowing her to chain momentum together to overcome low individual impact.\n\n\n【Starting Deck & Relic[]】\n\nThe Silent's starting deck is the largest of the 4 characters, at 12 cards, compared to the Ironclad's, Defect's and Watcher's starting deck, each of which have 10 cards. This means more Strikes and Defends are encountered in Act 1, and it's slightly more difficult to remove all starting cards from The Silent's Deck. The Silent's starting deck is also the cheapest, with its 2 non-Strike non-Defend cards costing 1 and 0. This means it's easier to take strong 2-cost card options earlier in the game, such as Dash, Predator, and Leg Sweep.\n\nHer starting Relic,  Ring of the Snake, ensures that the first turn of every fight is slightly stronger than all of the other turns. This makes Innate cards slightly better for Silent, since they only take up 1 of 7 cards instead of 1 of 5 cards. The \"Bottle Relics\" ( Bottled Flame,  Bottled Lightning, and  Bottled Tornado) have improved utility for similar reasons.\n\nOwing to these properties, the Silent's early-game performance is by far the weakest out of the four characters. Her lack of upfront damage leaves her ill-equipped to deal with Act 1 Elite encounters, particularly the Lagavulin and Gremlin Nob, if players do not fix the damage density of her starting deck. Thus, even getting a run started can be a challenge with the Silent, particularly on high Ascension levels. However, if players can overcome this hurdle, they will realize Silent's incredible late-game potential, where her performance is conversely the strongest on average. Her access to the strongest damage mitigation tools in the game, as well as consistent long-term scaling damage and card manipulation, make even decks that seem weak able to clear the Act 3 boss gauntlet and even the Corrupt Heart with correct play.\n\n\n【Synergies[]】\n\nListed below are the standard synergies that Silent decks build towards, which may give you an idea of direction for your own runs. Some important things to keep in mind:\n\n- Most of these builds aren't mutually exclusive. Think of each of the archetypes listed below as an engine that you can incorporate into your deck; depending on the situation, you are more than able to adapt or combine multiple of them.\n\n- It's important to not \"force\" a particular build from the outset of the game. Build your deck to solve your immediate problems first and foremost, then allow an archetype to come to you organically. The only exception would be if you run into cards or relics in the early-game that are both individually impactful and form the crux of an entire archetype, and such situations are few and far between.\n\nCards that are generally good in any Silent strategy include:\n\n- Well-Laid Plans. The ability to hold key cards for when you need them most is amazing, and part of why Silent is so strong into the late-game. You can hold that crucial Burst + Catalyst for when you've stacked up a critical mass of  Poison, Wraith Form for an enemy's biggest hits, etc. Even outside of these examples, simply holding over damage or block on a turn where you don't need either one quite yet can let you answer whatever the enemy throws at you.\n- Alchemize. Potions are an incredibly strong resource in Slay the Spire, especially as you climb the Ascension levels, owing to their ability to be deployed whenever you need them, or saved for crucial fights. A card that provides more of this resource thus makes every deck stronger.\n\n- Discard& Draw: WhilePoisonandShivsynergies usually capture the attention of newSpireplayers, Silent's biggest strength is arguably her card manipulation, much of which owes to her ability to cycle through the deck effortlessly. Herdiscardand card draw effects are thus the bread-and-butter of many of the strongest Silent decks, allowing unparalleled consistency in executing the deck's win condition.Cards that provide card draw:Acrobaticsis Silent's main cycling tool, allowing you to see 3 (4) new cards from your deck at a low cost, and even allows you to trigger discard synergies, all on a Common!Tools of the Tradeallows you to see an extra card every turn.Backflipdraws 2 while providing a small amount ofBlock. If your late-game Block plan involves stackingDexterity, this can provide an incredible amount of incidental Block for you while you look for your key cards.Preparedis nothing special unupgraded, as it merely replaces itself. However, Prepared+ is a very strong tool that allows you to dig further through your deck for free.Calculated Gambleallows you to see an entire new hand, and when upgraded, no longer Exhausts, meaning you can do this every cycle.Expertiseis by far the weakest out of Silent's card draw tools, as it is conditional, and she wants to keep a large hand anyway. However, if you have no other sources of draw that increase your hand size, it will do in a pinch.Cards that benefit off discards:Eviscerateis a premium frontloaded damage option for a deck that cycles a lot. It will frequently cost nothing and slam an enemy for a good chunk of damage, and synergizes well with any source ofStrengthor evenWrist Bladeif fully discounted.Sneaky Strikerefunds itself if you've discarded anything during the turn. By itself, it's a decent damage button for the early-game that retains some value later on. Later on, if you find any way to discount it (such as with the otherwise nicheSetup), it can even become anEnergygenerator!Concentrategives a huge burst ofEnergyfor decks that have a surplus of draw but not enough Energy generation. It becomes absolutely broken withRunic Pyramid, as you will almost be guaranteed to have a full hand, and Concentrate will make hand space for you to continue your turn.Tacticiangrants 1 (2)Energywhen discarded. If your deck can reliably discardTactician, then it has a steady supply ofEnergy, which makes most of your turns much more efficient. With a small enough deck, you can actually guarantee discardingTacticianmultiple times, which can become infinite.Reflexdraws 2 (3) cards when discarded. While not as crucial in a deck with a lot of Backflips and Acrobatics, it still has a strong place in Silent's kit. A fully upgradedReflexcombined withPrepared, upgradedCalculated Gamble, and a small deck can go infinite.While Silent's card draw power is usually in service of her other synergies, discard can occasionally be a win condition all by itself. The aforementioned infinites are one aveune for that, but these are some others:Tingsha/Tough Bandagesdeals 3 damage / grants 3 block on each discard. If you can get these relics, you can simply spam discard to fight for you without even having to play output cards!Phantasmal Killercan be your entire damage solve, as if you cycle enough, you can end up playing it on every single turn, removing the need to line it up carefully. Slamming the enemy with double damage Eviscerates and Sneaky Strikes can sometimes be enough even in the absence of traditional scaling.Grand Finale, while often niche, has its best showing in particularly discard- and draw-heavy decks, especially if you haveRunic Pyramid. Because you can control how much you draw every turn, with enough careful planning, you can get the Finale off with reasonable consistency.\n\n- Poison: PoisonBuilds usePoisonstacks as their main source of damage. With the right cards, you can ramp upPoisonstacks on an enemy very quickly and kill them in 1-2 turns. However, the usual style ofPoisonbuilds slowly ramp up stacks over time and whittle the enemy down over many turns.Noxious Fumes, on its own, will gradually build up more and more poison until the enemy dies. It allows many builds to play much more defensively, and stall out fights with full-defense turns, as they are passively dealing more and more damage. Synergizes amazingly withBlockBuilds. However, this playstyle struggles with enemies that scale by buffing their own strength.Malaiseis a great addition to aFumesbuild.Poisoned Stabis a decent damage source on its own, which becomes better when you have aPoisondeck and can reliably stackPoison.Catalyst, if you're able to play it multiple times, can exponentially increasePoisonto ridiculous levels in a single turn. WithNightmareorBurst(or both), you get extra plays out of yourCatalyst, which can quickly stack up hundreds ofPoison. This build has incredible single-target damage, but is very bad at damaging multiple targets (withoutThe Specimen), and requires a decent supply of draw/energy. Very good for all single-target encounters, and becomes worse the more enemies there are.AveragePoisoncards are not that great on their own, and only become stronger if you already have aPoisondeck built around them.BaneDeadly PoisonBouncing FlaskCrippling CloudEnvenomaddsPoisononto all of your attack cards. Works extremely well if you are able to play many attack cards in a turn. Synergizes well with cheap attacks likeEndless Agony, multiple-hit attacks likeRiddle with Holes,Finisher, andEviscerate, and pretty much allShiv-generating cards.Corpse Explosioncould help solve the lack of AoE damage ofPoison.Snecko Skullis very strong for poison decks; it simply just gives more poison to your existing poison cards. You get the best value from this using poison sources that give small stacks of poison at a time: namely,Noxious FumesandEnvenom. It also works well withBouncing Flask, since it applies poison multiple times.The Specimengives poison decks much-needed multi-target damage. This is a must-have if you encounter this relic and have committed to making a poison deck.\n\n- ShivDeck: A primarily damage-focused build that revolves around gaining and using manyShivsduring each combat. The Silent also has a fewRelicsthat are specifically for enhancing Shivs.Infinite Blades,Cloak and Dagger, andBlade Danceare absolute musts for the archetype. All addShivsto your hand. Amplified by strength cards and relics (i.e.J.A.X.,Shuriken,Kunai,Ornamental Fan). Don't forget to upgradeInfinite Bladesfirst so it appears innately in your hand.Wrist Bladeamplifies not onlyShivsbut Silent's other 0 energy attacks, such asSliceandBackstab. 0 energy attacks also have great synergy withChokeandA Thousand Cuts.Ninja Scrollcan quickly jump start your first turn every combat.Accuracyamplifies your shivs. The more, the better. Beware ofThe Awakened One.EnvenomappliesPoisonwhile you attack with barrages ofShivs. Couple with theSnecko Skullrelic for easy clears.Sadistic Naturealso combines extremely effectively with it; thePoisonfromEnvenomwill trigger the damage fromSadistic Nature. This strategy can serve as a bridge betweenPoisonandShivbuilds in case you end up with a mix of cards and relics suitable for each.Storm of Steelcan be a great finisher if you haveEnvenom.A couple ofAfter Imagesgive you great survivability due to card-spamming nature of this archetype.After unloading all yourShivs,Finisheradds free damage.Dead Branch-Shivswhen played, and so benefit from relics that trigger on card .Anchoris useful for surviving while setting up your combo since your initial setup will take up most of your energy (Infinite Blades,After Image,A Thousand Cuts, etc.)A Thousand Cutsprovides a good AoE damage for this deck.Chokeoffers strong single-target damage in aShivdeck. Also, sinceChokecauses the target to lose life instead of taking damage, it bypasses enemyBlock.Expertiseis very good for refilling your hand after playing your low-costShiv/Slice/Endless Agonycards.Since you will be playing a lot ofShiv, which is anAttack, you will trigger relics likeOrnamental Fan,Nunchaku,Kunai, andShurikenmany times.Shiv decks struggle againstTime Eater(because shiv decks rely on playing large volumes of cards) andCorrupt Heart(because of Beat of Death), so have a plan to account for those.Envenomcan help by adding passive damage to each shiv.Tungsten Rodcan mitigate Beat of Death entirely if the run is at low enough Ascension or if the player hasToriias well.\n\n- DexterityStacking +WeakChain: Silent's baseBlocknumbers are quite low, but her access toDexteritythroughFootwork, her ability to play many cards per turn, and her many cards that can keepWeakonto enemies, all prop up how low those numbers are. This can be a powerful late-game defense solution as the package is quite lightweight, yet can stall out combats effectively until the deck's main damage engine comes online.Sources ofDexterity:Footwork, which gives you 2 (3)Dexterityfor the rest of the combat. One or two copies can be enough, but it never hurts to include more — as many as you're able to without harming the consistency of your first cycle through the deck.Kunai, which gives you 1Dexterityevery time you play 3 Attacks in a single turn. This synergizes beautifully withShiv-generating cards, which basically turn into Dexterity generators while also dealing damage. If you find this relic early and lean into Shivs, you might not even need Footworks!Cloak and Daggerbecomes particularly good with this relic.Sources ofWeak:Neutralize+Sucker Punch+Crippling Cloudis AoEWeakthat can mitigate a large amount of damage while providing somePoisonticks.Leg Sweepis a card that provides bothWeakandBlockat the same time. It doesn't benefit as much fromDexteritydue to its high cost, but excels in stopping single-target damage.Block cards that benefit most from the accumulatedDexterity:Backflipis not only a good draw card but, as mentioned in the previous section, can incidentally generate lots ofBlockwhile helping you cycle if you have ample Dexterity.Deflectgoes from being relatively low-impact to potentially blocking for double-digit numbers for 0Energyonce you've put all the Footworks down, making it a good inclusion, particularly if you have lots of draw to find it consistently.Dodge and Rollscales withDexteritytwice, and gets extra value when you know you will be attacked every turn.Bluris very good at stackingBlockover multiple turns if you find yourself frequently overblocking. However, it's not as consistent asIronclad'sBarricadeat doing so, since it only lasts one turn. You need to use it wisely or have multiple copies of Blur if you are reliant on this for critical turns in the endgame.Other considerations:Burstis another strong card, as it basically doubles theBlockof your nextBlockcard (ortwowhen upgraded!) It goes very well with all the aboveBlockcards, especiallyDodge and RollandBlur, and is generally a strong card for turning on your damage engine as well.BaseDefendcards are actually quite strong with these types of synergies, and shouldn't be removed from the deck. If you identify that this will be your main defense solve, consider taking[Simplicity]atAncient Writingto upgrade them to bolster your base numbers even further. It's also one of the clearest applications of acceptingMark of the Bloomby taking[I Am Awake]atMind Bloom, because it will also upgrade all of the otherBlockcards you've added to your deck alongside any Footworks that haven't been upgraded, which can result in you taking no damage for the rest of the run.Paper Kraneamplifies the effectiveness of yourWeakfrom 25% to 40%. Due to how rounding inSpireworks, this can mitigate a lot more damage than you expect, so definitely take advantage of this relic if you find it.\n\n- Non-DexterityMitigation: The Silent also has a bevy of damage mitigation options to choose from that don't involveDexterity.Piercing Wailis perhaps the best example of this. It's a Common card that takes away 6 (8)Strengthfrom enemies for that turn — it completely shuts down multi-hits, notably completely blocking theCorrupt Heart's Blood Shots all the way into thethirdcycle, and can control multi-enemy encounters, all for just 1Energy. For multi-stage boss fights such as theAwakened OneorTime Eater, playing Piercing Wail on the turn they \"reset\" (before you kill the first phase of the Awakened One, or on the turn that Time Eater clears debuffs and heals back to half) will cause them to permanently lose that much Strength. Every deck benefits from at least a few copies of Piercing Wail.Malaiseis one of the strongest cards in Silent's card pool, being able to not only keepWeakon an enemy but also permanently reduce theirStrength, neutering multi-hits in the process. It is one of the very best solutions toTime Eaterin particular, and can buy enough time forShivstrategies to scale without fearing giving the boss too muchStrength.After Imageis a very goodBlockcard with huge value throughout every combat. For 1Energy, you get usually at least 4-5 block every turn for the rest of combat. It synergizes very well with card-generation cards and 0-Energycards, and goes particularly well intoShivstrategies.Wraith Formis one of the most powerful individual cards in the game, giving youIntangiblefor 2 (3) turns. Often times, this is enough time to straight-up end hallway fights because you can now focus all of yourEnergyon attacking without much fear of taking damage. If you have multiple copies of Wraith Form or a way to duplicate it (such as withNightmare),After Imageto block chip damage, orOrange Pelletsto erase theDexterity-down debuff, you can even ignore its downside completely. OnAscension19 and 20, it also lowers theCorrupt Heart'sBeat of Deathdamage down from 2 or 3 to 1.Other considerations:Nightmarecan be a difficult card to pick, but with enough card manipulation and the correct targets (most of which are defensive), it can provide an out to every fight in the game. It is best with cards listed in this section, such as Malaise, After Image, and Wraith Form, as they all become significantly stronger in multiples. However, it can also be used to duplicateFootworkas well, in case you don't have enough for a particular fight. Two copies of Nightmare (one used to duplicate the other) can allow you to duplicate cards indefinitely, so long as you have theEnergyfor it. Nightmare can also duplicateAlchemizeto increase your chances of finding strong Potions, most notablyGhost in a Jarwhich is a free turn ofIntangible.\n\n\n【Unlocks[]】\n\nThe Silent is unlocked by completing a run with The Ironclad.\n\n- Unlock Number: 1st, Prizes Unlocked: Bane,Catalyst,Corpse Explosion\n- Unlock Number: 2nd, Prizes Unlocked: Du-Vu Doll,Smiling Mask,Tiny Chest\n- Unlock Number: 3rd, Prizes Unlocked: Cloak and Dagger,Accuracy,Storm of Steel\n- Unlock Number: 4th, Prizes Unlocked: Art of War,The Courier,Pandora's Box\n- Unlock Number: 5th, Prizes Unlocked: Concentrate,Setup,Grand Finale\n\n\n【Gallery[]】"}]}
{"conversations": [{"role": "user", "content": "What knowledge is there about 'Watcher' in Slay the Spire?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The Watcher is one of four playable characters in Slay the Spire. She is a monk that utilizes the effects of her different stances to her advantage, boasts an arsenal oriented around deck control via scrying,  retain, and Energy generation, as well as a unique focus on mid-combat card generation. She starts with 72 HP.\n\nThe Watcher's starting Relic is  Pure Water, which adds a Miracle to your hand at the start of each combat.\n\nThe Watcher was first added to the beta build in the Testing the Fourth Character update and released to the public on January 15th, 2020.\n\n\n【Cards[]】\n\n\n【Starting Deck[]】\n\n- 4 Strike\n- 4 Defend\n- 1 Eruption\n- 1 Vigilance\n\n\n【Relics[]】\n\nThe Watcher has fewer class-specific relics than the other classes, having only two class-specific rare relics (rather than three like the Ironclad and Silent), and only two class-specific boss relics (rather than three, like those two and the Defect). The Defect has equally few overall, but is short two Rare relics instead of one Rare relic and one Boss relic.\n\nUncommon Relics:  Duality,  Teardrop Locket\n\nRare Relics:  Cloak Clasp,  Golden Eye\n\nBoss Relics:  Holy Water (replaces  Pure Water),  Violet Lotus\n\n\n【Strategy[]】\n\nThe Watcher's gameplay centers nearly entirely around stances. She is, on average, much more powerful than the original 3 classes, owing primarily to the Wrath stance that allows her to double damage output and thus kill every enemy before they can retaliate. However, not every fight will present an immediate kill opportunity, and thus care needs to be taken so that the Watcher does not get stuck in Wrath on a bad turn and take large amounts of unnecessary damage in return. To this end, mechanics such as Scry and several cards that have  Retain allow her to carefully choose turn actions, including even a turn or two ahead, to make sure she has a way to change stances at will to either escape danger or generate energy.\n\nMost Watcher strategies will center around a small selection of key cards that she will want to play over and over again. Also notably, the Watcher's starter deck has significantly more power than other characters', allowing players to be much more picky with card selection even at higher Ascension levels. Because of this, consistent Watcher decks tend to be much smaller than average. However, it is not impossible (albeit more difficult) to succeed with a larger deck full of value cards.\n\n\n【Build types[]】\n\nListed below are the standard synergies that Watcher decks build towards, which may give you an idea of direction for your own runs. Unlike other characters, because Watcher's starter Deck is so powerful, you can get away with \"forcing\" a build more often, even at higher difficulties. However, you should still be open to taking cards that solve your immediate problems if they arise, as well as have the awareness to switch gears should key cards not be offered to you.\n\n- StanceDance (Standard): \"Stance dancing\" is the most fundamental way to play the Watcher, and arguably the most consistent. Load up on good damage cards and switch betweenWrathandCalmas the situation necessitates, dishing out massive damage while keeping yourself out of harm's way. Ensure you have many ways to change Stances, as you do not want to be stranded in Wrath without any Block on the wrong turn.The following are the key to success in Stance Dancing decks:1-cost, reusableWrathentries (Eruption+,Tantrum, orIndignation);1-cost, reusableCalmentries (Inner PeaceorFear No Evil) or aVigilancewithViolet Lotus;At least 1 copy ofRushdown.Keep in mind that switching between Calm and Wrath with 1-cost entries isEnergy-neutral, as leaving Calm refunds 2 Energy. This is what makes the Watcher such a powerful class - she has almost complete control of her Energy flow, being able to extract as much value out of every point as possible by either bursting down enemies, or banking Energy for a future turn. Ensure that you are building and playing such that you can fully take advantage of the value the stances provide.Also strongly consider taking some of the following:Meditateis one of the best cards in this Deck, allowing you to end the turn in Calm as well as set up your next turn perfectly by recycling key cards. It also pairs excellently withRetainsynergies if you choose to run cards such asEstablishmentandSands of Time.Simmering Furyis a good one-two punch withMeditateand gives you massive setup potential, especially if you haveRushdown- you can basically fill up your entire hand for the next turn!Flurry of Blowskeeps your offense going as you switch stances and can help quickly put an end to hallway fights.Mental Fortressbecomes almost mandatory in this Deck as the bestBlockplan available. Many non-infinite stance Decks take multiples of this card to ensure they never have issues blocking in the late-game.Talk to the Handis also excellent, especially withTantrumandFlurry of Blows, but can struggle against foes withArtifact.Haltis also an excellent Block supplement and even scales multiple times withDexterityif you have a source of it.The \"Empty\" cards (Empty Body,Empty Fist, andEmpty Mind) are excellent in this Deck, and count as stance changes to triggerMental FortressandFlurry of Blows.In larger Decks,TranquilityandCrescendoare decent picks for theirRetain, letting you enter either stance at will (and for free when upgraded) on critical turns where you can't dig towards your reusable changers.\n\n- StanceDance (Infinite): The Watcher is notorious among some players for having consistent and easy access to this infinite. Once the infinite is achieved, the Watcher can demolish everything in her way up to theCorrupt Heartwith little difficulty.The key components to the infinite are the following:A 1-cost, reusableWrathentry (Eruption+,Tantrum, orIndignation);A 1-cost, reusableCalmentry (Inner PeaceorFear No Evil) or aVigilancewithViolet Lotus;At least 1 copy ofRushdown;Card draw to put your entire Deck in your hand (most commonly withScrawlorEmpty Mind).For the infinite, it's important to keep your deck as small as possible. If leaving yourself open to this build, do not take too many cards early on; one or two good damage cards to beat the first few Elites is enough.The game plan with the Stance Dance infinite is simply to putRushdowninto play, then put your entire Deck in your hand. Then, enter Calm, and immediately exit to Wrath. Rushdown will redraw both cards you just played, and you will have lost noEnergy, as Calm refunds 2 Energy while it took 2 to play both cards. Repeat this process until the fight is over.While this infinite is incredibly powerful and solves almost every fight in the game once established, it's important to be prepared for the few fights that can put a stop to this strategy. You must also take care during the transitional period between getting all of the pieces and slimming your Deck down enough to execute the infinite on turn 1.Mental Fortressshould be an auto-include if you are going up against the Corrupt Heart orTime Eater. These are the only two fights that will force you to generateBlock. With enough stance dancing, you will blank all of their attacks, even if you cannot kill them in one turn.Talk to the Handwill also suffice, but will not generate as much Block per cycle, especially against the Time Eater.Runic Pyramidhas several uses in this build, most notably to ensure that you can execute the infinite against the Heart or Time Eater every turn. It also aids greatly if your Deck is still slightly too large to execute the infinite on turn 1. If you must spend your first turn playing your Powers or cards that Exhaust to slim down the Deck, Runic Pyramid helps you keep everything in your hand so that you are ready to go infinite the next turn.Peace Pipecan be an absolute godsend in this build, allowing you to be several card removals ahead of the curve. You will only need to upgrade a few key cards, so the opportunity cost of Toking once those upgrades are done will be essentially nonexistent. For similar reasons, findingSmiling Maskshould also push you towards this build.\n\n- Mantra/Divinity: Divinitystance is to the Watcher asDarkOrbs are to theDefect. They aren't usually part of the character's core strategy, but the payoff for making them work is second to none.Upon entering Divinity through generating 10Mantra, the Watcher gains 3Energyand tripled damage, but the stance only lasts until the end of the turn. A successful Mantra strategy will thus look for ways to accelerate both its active and passive generation to consistently enter Divinity at the right times without sustaining too much damage beforehand. Afterwards, it should strive to extend each Divinity turn as much as possible.Key cards and considerations in this build:Devotioncan be an nice inclusion to this build, though it must be upgraded. Devotion is unfortunately very slow, but in longer fights (such as boss fights), it can be very powerful. It stacks very well with itself, and if you can somehow put 3 of these into play, you can enter Divinity every turn with ease.Prostrateis one of the best active Mantra generators, as getting the free block on cast can make this a fine pick in the early game. However, the low amount of Mantra given (2, or 3 when upgraded) means that it's very difficult to enter Divinity off of just Prostrate alone.Pray, on the other hand, is rarely worth taking. The issue with Pray is that it does literally nothing on the turn you cast it, unless you're entering Divinity. Additionally, because you had to draw Pray, then draw theInsight, just to draw 2 cards, the end result is that you didn't draw any cards. This makes Pray one of the worst cards in the game for a normal deck, unless you're incredibly committed to achieving Divinity. However, if you can assemble a small enough deck (less than 9 cards) that can somehow generate a lot of energy, a Pray+ can essentially re-draw itself and an insight over and over.Worshipcosts 2 energy, and generates 5 Mantra without doing anything else. Unlike Prostrate and Pray+, Worship is energy negative. However, it can allow you to enter Divinity through just two cycles of your deck, meaning Worship can be great as your only mantra-generating card. However, having this card be upgraded (which gives itRetain) is critical, as it means that it can be cast on turns where you have the energy, while also allowing you to enter Divinity at the perfect moment. Finally, if you're runningOmniscience, choosing Worship allows you to instantly enter Divinity, and costs 0 energy if Omniscience is upgraded, which is an incredibly powerful combo.Before entering Divinity, the Watcher should ideally be inCalm- this will provide a massive surge of energy and allow you to achieve lethal much more easily. Thus, 1-cost reusable Calm entries such as are strong inclusions, though watch out forFear No Evilcausing you to leave Divinity.After entering Divinity, you will want to make the most use out of the massive surge of Energy - thus, having a large hand is paramount. Any source of card draw, includingWheel Kick,Cut Through Fate,Scrawl, and Insights generated from Pray, are very powerful, as are attacks that retain from previous turns such asSands of Time. Inner Peace can also provide card draw before the entrance.Wallopis also a strong choice for this deck. Divinity solves your damage, but can struggle against fights that force you to defend, which Wallop fixes by providing a huge burst ofBlockwhile barely easing up on the offense.Damarucan be a solid boost to Mantra generation if you can find it. It often can reduce the amount of turns it takes to achieve divinity by one. However, the relic is pretty useless without any other divinity cards.Other notes:Do not useBlasphemy, as it is counterproductive to what the deck is already doing.Fastingis a great option as it gives you a burst ofStrengthandDexterity. The latter is especially important as it will boost the blocking power ofProstrateand ensure you have no issues defending, especially against the Corrupt Heart. Once everything is set up, you will generate so much Energy that it offsets the loss from Fasting. However, it does make the early stages of the fight much more precarious, unless you haveOrange Pellets.Brillianceis strong if you have a thin Deck with not a lot of attacks, as it can scale essentially unbounded and be a one-card damage solve. However, be wary of situations where Brilliance becomes a \"win-more\" card - Divinity offers plenty of damage already, so you may be set with what you already have.Ultimately, one of the best ways to consider Divinity cards is to consider how many cycles through your deck it takes to achieve Divinity. For example, a card that gives 3 mantra takes 4 deck cycles to reach Divinity, while a card that gives 4 mantra would take 3 deck cycles. Thus, you should ultimately achieve to have your mantra cards give a total of either 5 or 10 mantra each deck cycle.DevotionandDamarucan also help with this. As an example of a great Divinity deck, a deck with an upgradedProstrate, aWorship, and aDamarucan easily achieve 10 Mantra in just 2-3 turns.\n\n- RetainBuild: This build is primarily defensive, and wants to utilizeEstablishmentto lower the cost of your cards and build up to one incredibly powerful turn once costs are reduced and cards are powered up. This deck is going to be lower on attacks and heavy on skills.Establishment- This is your best card. If you find it early, grab it and upgrade it the first chance you can get. Upgrading gives itInnate, meaning you will always draw it and only need one.Sands of Time- Your best attack card. WithEstablishment, it will be free in two turns. It is leagues more powerful thanWindmill Strikein your average Watcher deck, as it can sit in your hand for a few turns, then be a free (or very cheap) 40 damage after casting Eruption. Picking up a Sands of Time early in Act 1 is often what gets you into the Retain build.Windmill Strike- Your other attack card. This can sit in your hand and have its cost reduced thanks toEstablishment, followed by aStancechange to Wrath, likely killing your target. However, it takes 4 turns to become better than Sands of Time, resulting in it usually being worse.Meditate- This card combos withEstablishmentas well, since the two cards will be reduced as soon you pick them up. This will reduce the cost of any card you pick up, even if they don't haveRetain. As well, going intoCalmcan help end a big turn.You can set up a variety of infinites on small deck if you reduce cost of reusable cycling/draw cards, e.g.Inner Peace,Cut Through Fate.Crescendo/Tranquility- It is preferable to have at least one of each in your deck. No need to upgrade them if you haveEstablishment, since they will cost 0 one turn later.Spirit Shield- It's rare, but the best defensive card for this build, especially because you will have many cards in your hand. Upgrade this if you can, though it is optional to do so.Scrawl- This allows you to fill up your hand, picking up severalRetaincards.Cut Through Fate- This is a great card regardless of your build. It is preferable to have one to help smooth out card draws.Perseverance/Protect/Flying Sleeves- Your most simple cards. You'll likely want at least one of each defensive card, hopefully twoProtectsif you can find them.Of note, a couple ofScrycards can be useful. This helps filter out curses, andThird Eyecan still be useful even if it isn't aRetaincard.Just Luckyalone isn't enough for this purpose.\n\n- RagnarokBuild: ARagnarokdeck focuses on keeping a thin deck with a way to defend yourself until you get the perfect turn to unleash a buffed attack hopefully killing anything in your way. It helps to get the card fairly early, but a lot of Wrath-based decks can include it efficiently.Ragnarok- The namesake of this deck, this card scales extremely well with theWrathstance as well as several other cards. Upgrading it is a must.Wreath of Flame- On an unupgradedRagnarok, a singleWreath of Flamewill add an additional 25 damage to the attack. Stacking this card is very important for the burst attack.Blasphemy- This card is very powerful for any burst damage decks, triple damage and 2Energywith in practice no downsides if you can finish the fight that turn. The upgraded version lets you retain this card for the right moment when you'll drawRagnarok.Crush Jointsand/orTrip- Combining the vulnerable debuff on top of a wrath or divinity stance andWreath of Flameshould kill most enemy or boss in one cast of ragnarok. An upgradedTripis especially useful if usingRagnarokas AOE on a group of enemies and to removeArtifactstacks.Deus Ex Machina- Saving theMiraclesgiven by this card will allow you to buff yourRagnarokeven more by allowing you to play moreWreath of Flame.Third Eye- Gives you survivability while also allowing you to prune your draws just the way you like them.Scrawl- Upgraded, this card lets you fill up your hand with potentially moreWreath of Flameswithout losing anyEnergy.Fasting- Gives yourRagnarokmore damage, however sacrifices some energy. Good if you get an early energy relic and can reliably drawDeus Ex Machina.\n\n- ScryBuild: Scryenables you to refine what you draw, and cards such asWeaveandNirvanacan turnScryinginto a powerful action. Similar in play-style to the Flurry Stance deck, doesn't need to be kept thin at all due to theScrying, which can go through large decks quickly.Weave- Similar toFlurry of Blows, you will want as many of these as possible, as you can return them all to your hand multiple times per turn. When Scrying, these should always be discarded, since they will immediately return themselves to your hand.Nirvana- Rewards you withBlockuponscrying. Serves a similar function toMental Fortressbut for aScrydeck; if you have many of them, you can chain up large amounts of block effortlessly. Upgrade priority.Foresight- The best card to have at least 1 of for this deck. Every turn you triggerNirvanaand get to play everyWeaveagain. Upgrading it/obtaining additional copies won't trigger this more than once, however it will allow you to fine tune your draw more carefully, and throw moreWeavesinto the discard pile.Cut Through Fate- A distinctly powerful card that not only grants you aScry, but draws a card. The card draw is valuable for getting those Scry-curated cards from the top of your deck into your hand.Just Lucky- Brilliant utility card for this deck, since the scry amount matters far less than the act of scrying itself. Returning every Weave to your hand for free is the primary use of this coin.Third Eye- Solid card with a scry effect. In case it isn't obvious, you want as many cards that scry as possible.Talk to the Hand- Just as with the Stance Dancer deck, attacking with numerous small attacks makes this card a fantastic addition to the deck, and can even enable you to safely remain inWrathif you so desire.\n\n- Pressure Points: Relying onPressure Pointsand not much else, the strategy is to limit your deck size to be as small as possible, while having as manyPressure Pointsas possible. Potent against single enemies but falters against groups andArtifact.Pressure Points- the focal point of the deck, get as many as possible and upgrade where possible.Calm- Due toPressure Pointsnot gaining a buff from being inWrath, there's not much motivation to exitCalm. Considers picking cards that help entering, or capitalize on remaining inCalmInner Peace- Helps you draw morePressure Pointsand cycle your deck faster while inCalm.Like Water- Grants quite potentBlockwhile you remains inCalm. Get as many as you can find to bolster this deck defensive nature.Meditate- Apart from enteringCalm, it can return one or twoPressure Pointsthat you have played to your hand. If you have this card, consider pickingEstablishmentto help reduce the cost of cards thatMeditatereturns from discard pile.ExitingCalmmay also be used to gain resources in a pinch. To avoid doubling enemy attack damage, consider cards such asEmpty Fist,Empty Body, andEmpty Mind. The last two are especially effective in this deck as it grantsBlockand card draw, respectively.Sanctity- As you rely onPressure Points, aSkillcard, to deal damage,Sanctitywill almost always help you draw additional cards and cycle your deck faster.Wave of the Hand- Can help strippingArtifactoff from enemies so thatPressure Pointscan apply its debuff and deal damage.Deus Ex Machina- Due toPressure Pointscosting 1, resources will continuously be your limiting factor. Anything that allows you to gain extra resources is a blessing.Signature Move- BecausePressure Points, this deck's primary offense, is counted as aSkill, you will be able to play this card far more often.\n\n- Creation: The Watcher has more cards that create other cards than any other character. This strategy aims to make the most of flooding your hand with powerful, mostly one-use cards.Master Reality- The cornerstone of this deck, Master Reality makes every created card much more useful. Once upgraded, it costs zero energy to use.Battle Hymn/Study- Aggro powers that create useful cards every turn that crucially retain, enabling you to keep them until the perfect moment.Deceive Reality/Evaluate- Defensive skills that create useful, self-retaining cards.Spirit Shield- Insight and retain cards can quickly and reliably max out your hand, greatly augmenting the potential of this block.Conjure Blade- This is a potential game winner, if connected to enough energy. This entire deck can be focused down to defending until you can produce a powerful enough Expunger, and then wiping the floor with that.Deus Ex Machina/Vault/Blasphemy- Aside fromDeva Formand various relics, these cards are your best bets for generating the energy necessary to make the most of this deck.Establishment- Since most created cards retain, this card give you much more value from them.\n\n- Alpha: Alpha is a card which requires a lot of investment within fights (you have to draw 3 cards and play 6 mana just for it to work), but has a really awesome pay-off if you can pull it off. Generally Alpha decks work best when they are small and contain a lot of supporting block cards. Creating an alpha deck is a popular way to complete the minimalist achievement, as you essentially only need alpha combined with a few block cards to win the game.Alpha- The backbone of this deck. Alpha shuffles a Beta into your deck.Beta- Beta shuffles Omega into your deck. This isn't a card you can pick up (unfortunately) but is rather something that is generated during fights.Omega- Omega is aPowerthat, once played, will deal 50 damage to all enemies at the end of your turn. It is worth noting that it will deal the 50 damageEVERYturn. The damage is not affected byWrathstance orDivinity. Omega quickly clears hallway fights and elites - however, you may need to continue blocking for a few turns to finish bosses off.Omniscience- Omniscience really shines in this deck. For 3 (or 4) mana you can essentially rip Omega right out of your deck and play it twice. That is 100 damageper turn.If you are in a really sticky situation it can sometimes be worth playing Omniscience on Beta to ensure that you will draw Omega next turn, but this is generally not advised.Third Eye- This card gives you both block and scry, things that this deck really needs. Block is so you can live long enough to play Omega and scry so you can make sure that you draw it.Deceive Reality/Evaluate- Whilst these aren't quite as good as third eye, they both work towards the blocking/surviving objective.Sanctity- You need to be careful playing this card. It gives you block and draws cards at the same time which in theory are very good things for this deck. Also, your deck should be full of mainly skills cards so you shouldn't have any trouble triggering its secondary effect. However, if you play sanctity without enough mana to play the next stage of your alpha combo, you could be doing yourself a major disservice.For example: you start the game with 3 mana. If you play alpha, then sanctity you only have 1 mana left. If sanctity draws Beta it then gets stuck in your discard pile.Duplication Potion- Omega's best friend. Similar to Omniscience but in potion form.Miraclesources such asDeus Ex MachinaandCollectcan be used to lessen the cost of Omega on the turn you cast it.\n\n\n【Unlocks[]】\n\nThe Watcher is unlocked by completing an unseeded run (defeating Act 3 boss) with any base-game character, if the Defect is already unlocked.

Removed when attacked X times in a single turn. Charges are refilled back to X at the start of each turn if not fully removed.\n\n\nType\nBuff\n\n\nStackingBehavior\nIntensity\n\nByrds are weak enemies found in Act 2 that begin each battle with a flying buff. Until each Byrd is dealt attack damage three times (four times on Ascension 17+) in one turn, it will take half damage from all attacks. This combined with its  Strength scaling and multi-hit attacks make the Byrd a fearsome foe for some decks.\n\n\n【Pattern[]】\n\nCan only use Peck or Caw on the first turn with a 62.5% chance for Peck and 37.5% chance for Caw. Afterwards, has a 50% chance of using Peck, 20% chance of using Swoop, and 30% chance of using Caw. Cannot use Peck three times in a row and cannot use Caw or Swoop twice in a row.\n\nBecause Byrds have the Flying buff, they will only take half of the damage dealt until they are hit three(or four on Ascension 17+) times in a turn. Here is the sequence of events when a Byrd loses its Flying buffs:\n\n- It will get stunned instantly, interrupting its previous intent;\n- It will use Headbutt the following turn;\n- It will use Fly.\n- Returns to its original pattern when Flying.\n\n- Name: Caw, Intent: , Effect: Gains 1Strength.\n- Name: Peck, Intent: , Effect: Deals 1x5 damage.\n- Name: Swoop, Intent: , Effect: Deals 12 damage\n- Name: Fly, Intent: , Effect: Gains Flying 3.\n- Name: Headbutt, Intent: , Effect: Deals 3 damage.\n\n\n【Tips[]】\n\n- Because Byrds attack so many times in one turn and have low HP,  Thorns is very powerful in this fight.\n- Attacks that hit multiple enemies multiple times, such as Dagger Spray, are very useful for removing the Byrds' Flying buff.\n- It is more important to attack a Byrd if it is buffing its  Strength; its next turn will be much stronger unless it is knocked down or killed.\n- Indirect forms of damage, such as from the Defect's orbs or  Poison, ignore the Byrds' Flying buff and are therefore more powerful in this fight.\n- If a Byrd is dealt attack damage more than enough times to knock it down with a single card, the Byrd will be knocked down after the card's effects are finished. Thus, using Whirlwind with 5 Energy will deal half damage to all Byrds 5 times.\n\n\n【Trivia[]】\n\n- The name \"Byrd\" is just \"Bird\" spelled with a \"y\".\n\n\n【Gallery[]】\n\n\n【Update History[]】\n\n- Weekly Patch 45: Impatience\nFlight's power description now correctly resets at the start of turn.\n- Flight's power description now correctly resets at the start of turn.\n- Weekly Patch 42: Reboot\nAdding SFX for Byrd peck attack.\nUpdating SFX for Flight and Focus Powers.\n- Adding SFX for Byrd peck attack.\n- Updating SFX for Flight and Focus Powers.\n- Weekly Patch 41: Chill\nAdded additional SFX for Byrd's peck attack.\nAdding SFX for Byrd cawing.\n- Added additional SFX for Byrd's peck attack.\n- Adding SFX for Byrd cawing.\n- Weekly Patch 40: Forethought\nAdding SFX for Time Warp, Flight, Constricted, and Entangle Powers.\n- Adding SFX for Time Warp, Flight, Constricted, and Entangle Powers.\n- Weekly Patch 19: Seed\nFixed the turn order for Chosen + Byrd encounter.

Thus, it is good to kill them after the high priority targets have been dealt with, but before every other gremlin has been killed. You may need to adjust your priorities based on which gremlins the Shield Gremlin chooses to protect. It may be good to attack the Shield Gremlin first if a Gremlin Wizard is present, as the Shield Gremlin may interfere with killing the Gremlin Wizard quickly.\nAngry Gremlins do the least damage initially, but their damage will increase as you attack them. Thus, it is best to  Block their attacks for the first few rounds until you can afford to focus on them and kill them quickly.\nGremlin Wizards are a bit trickier to deal with. While they only attack once every three turns, their damage can be difficult to  Block in Act 1. Ideally, you should kill them before they get a chance to use Ultimate Blast, which may require focusing on them before other lower priority gremlins.\n- Sneaky Gremlins deal the most direct damage, and should be dealt with on the first turn if possible, before they can be protected by a Shield Gremlin and before a Fat Gremlin can weaken you.\n- Fat Gremlins apply  Weak, which can make killing the other gremlins more difficult, so they should often be dealt with next.\n- Shield Gremlins will only deal damage to you if they have no allies left to protect.

Consider blocking if your attacks in hand are subpar. Because of its buff, the Orb Walker can snowball very quickly. As with most heavy-hitters,  Weak can be a very powerful asset to buy you more time. The  Weak Potion is also effective as the three  Weak will lessen damage every single turn, and the Orb Walker always attacks.\n\nIn its Event encounter, focusing on one and then the next is typically the best strategy.

While the Spheric Guardian will continue to build  Block, dealing with more than one attack while  Frail can be overwhelming.\n- If playing as the Defect, a very useful card in this fight is Melter, which will remove the enemy's  Block and deal significant damage, almost effectively ending the fight.\n- If playing as the Watcher, Judgment will instantly kill it.\n\n\n【Gallery[]】\n\n\n【Update History[]】\n\n- Weekly Patch 40: Forethought\nSome minor fixes for Spheric Guardian audio.

Her access to Footwork and multiple cheap  Block cards allow her to easier stack  Block against the Book. Leg Sweep not only grants a huge  Block, but also apply a large number of  Weak.

This also means that the new gremlins spawned do not carry the old gremlins'  Strength buffs.\n- Any minion from this fight (i.e. spawned gremlins or gremlins that come in the fight) will retreat and be defeated if the Gremlin Leader is defeated.\n- While Gremlin Leader may summon minions continually, it is important to kill Gremlin Wizards; their attacks are very strong. Killing a Fat Gremlin may also help kill the Leader faster due to its  Weak debuff no longer being applied.\n- Gremlin Leader continually buffs her allies'  Strength, so killing her quickly is important to avoid her attacks from becoming too deadly.\n\n\n【Trivia[]】\n\n- Gremlin Leader is confirmed to be female by one of the developers.[1]\n\n\n【Update History[]】\n\n- Patch V1.1: The Dealer\nFixed enemy order issues in Slime Boss, Gremlin Leader, and Reptomancer encounters.\n- Fixed enemy order issues in Slime Boss, Gremlin Leader, and Reptomancer encounters.\n- Weekly Patch 37: Darkness\nGremlin Leader HP lowered. 155 - 164 -> 140 - 148.

Afterwards, has a 33% chance of using  Skull Bash and a 67% chance of using  Rush. Cannot use  Rush 3 times in a row.\n\nAt  Ascension 18+, uses  Skull Bash on the 2nd turn and uses  Rush twice afterwards. Repeats this pattern for the entire fight.\n\n\n【Tips[]】\n\n- With the exception of the first turn, where it has yet to apply  Enrage, playing Skills will make the Gremlin Nob much more threatening. Since most  Block-granting cards are also Skills, it can be worth more to not play them and take the damage instead. Before using a Skill to mitigate damage, consider how much longer the fight might take.\nWith the Ironclad's Basic deck, the fight is about being as aggressive as possible until the very end. Use Bash to apply  Vulnerable as much as possible, and play every Strike attack you're dealt. When you feel the Nob will only have one turn left to live, it can be beneficial to play a Defend versus a  Skull Bash.  Burning Blood will absorb some of the impact of the fight at the end.\nWith the Silent's Basic deck, the fight becomes more painful. The objective, however, does not change. Neutralize helps to mitigate some of the damage. Taking 4 or 10 damage should be much more manageable. Otherwise, lay in with Strikes whenever possible.\nWith the Defect's Basic deck the fight plays out similar to the Silent. Despite the strength gain it may be worth it to cast Zap early in the fight (especially if you traded away your  starting relic) and Dualcast late in the fight. Dualcast often lets you finish him off a whole turn earlier, making the strength gain irrelevant.\nWith the Watcher's Basic deck, focus on maintaining aggression and play strong offensive cards. It is usually worth to take damage as the Watcher's style of gameplay can deal excessive amounts of damage in a single turn. Playing cards which enable Wrath or Divinity such as Eruption or Blasphemy to deal a large amount of burst damage can easily finish off the Gremlin Nob.\nPowers and Potions can both be effective at mitigating damage in place of Skills.\n- With the Ironclad's Basic deck, the fight is about being as aggressive as possible until the very end.

On 17 January 2019 this was changed to one Gremlin Nob and a Taskmaster instead.\n- The Gremlin Nob wields a skeleton of a creature which is extremely similar to the rat-like rodent infested by the Fungi Beast. However, there are no rodent monsters in the game.\n\n\n【Update History[]】\n\n- Slay the Spire 1.0: Farewell Early Access\nColossuem Nob fight ordering swapped so that the Nob can apply Vulnerable.\n- Colossuem Nob fight ordering swapped so that the Nob can apply Vulnerable.\n- Weekly Patch 56: The Collector\nColosseum event's second fight is now a Gremlin Nob + Taskmaster (rather than 2 Gremlin Nobs)\n- Colosseum event's second fight is now a Gremlin Nob + Taskmaster (rather than 2 Gremlin Nobs)\n- Weekly Patch 41\nColosseum Nobs no longer play double music.\nKilling a Colosseum Nob no longer causes the music to stop.\n- Colosseum Nobs no longer play double music.\n- Killing a Colosseum Nob no longer causes the music to stop.\n- Day 1 Patch\nGremlin Nob gets a minor nerf.\n- Gremlin Nob gets a minor nerf.\n\n- Monsters,Elites, andBosses: Act I\n- Monsters,Elites, andBosses: Act II\n- Monsters,Elites, andBosses: ••••••\n- Monsters,Elites, andBosses: Act III\n- Monsters,Elites, andBosses: ••\n- Monsters,Elites, andBosses: Act IV"}]}

It hits heavily and consistently, but is found asleep for the first three turns of combat, unless encountered in the Dead Adventurer Event. This allows the player to decide when to start the fight properly, within reason.\n\n\n【Awakening[]】\n\nLagavulin will start with the unique debuff \"Asleep\", as well as a  Metallicize buff, preventing it from taking any action, but granting it 8  Block at the start of every turn. Lagavulin will wake up at the end of its 3rd turn or when any HP damage is taken through the  Block, and will lose its  Metallicize buff in the process.\n\nWhen Lagavulin wakes up by being attacked, it will be stunned for one turn. If Lagavulin wakes up on its own, it will begin the fourth turn unstunned.\n\n\n【Pattern[]】\n\nWill attack twice, then uses Siphon Soul; repeats this pattern for the entire duration of the fight.\n\n- Name: Attack, Intent: , Effect: Deal 18 damage., Asc 3+: Deal 20 damage., Asc 18+: Deal 20 damage.\n- Name: Siphon Soul, Intent: , Effect: Inflicts -1Dexterity, then -1Strength., Asc 3+: Inflicts -1Dexterity, then -1Strength., Asc 18+: Inflicts -2Dexterity, then -2Strength.\n\n\n【Tips[]】\n\n- Use the three turns before Lagavulin wakes up to prepare for the fight by using Powers and/or using Skills.\nAlternatively, it may be more reasonable to deal damage instead of buffs/debuffs if a large amount of damage is possible.\n- Alternatively, it may be more reasonable to deal damage instead of buffs/debuffs if a large amount of damage is possible.\n- Try to stay mostly aggressive for the fight; its Siphon Soul ability will gradually make the fight harder which can be lethal.\n- The Defect can be an easier character to fight against Lagavulin with than the others, as its Focus (which dictates how effective orbs are) will not be decreased by Siphon Soul.\n- If you have one  Artifact charge when Siphon Soul is used, it will block the dexterity debuff since that is applied first.\n\n\n【Trivia[]】\n\n- Lagavulin comes from Gaelic language 'Lag a’ Mhuilinn' which means 'hollow of the mill'.\n- Lagavulin references a distillery located in Islay, Scotland.

Smoke billows from the skull's eye sockets.\n\n- The main trick of the Nemesis is their use of  Intangible, a buff that reduces all damage dealt to it to 1.\n\n\n【Pattern[]】\n\nHas a 50% chance of using Debuff or attacking on the first turn.\n\nAfterwards, has approximately* a 35% chance of using Debuff, 35% chance of attacking and 30% chance of using Scythe.\n\nIt cannot use Debuff or Scythe twice in a row, nor can it use Attack three times in a row.\n\n*The exact AI of Nemesis is a bit more complicated, but the numbers are still almost completely accurate.\n\n- Name: Debuff, Intent: , Effect: Shuffles 3Burnsinto your discard pile., Asc 3+: Shuffles 3Burnsinto your discard pile., Asc 18+: Shuffles 5Burnsinto your discard pile.\n- Name: Attack, Intent: , Effect: Deals 6 x 3 damage., Asc 3+: Deals 7 x 3 damage., Asc 18+: Deals 7 x 3 damage.\n- Name: Scythe, Intent: , Effect: Deals 45 damage., Asc 3+: Deals 45 damage., Asc 18+: Deals 45 damage.\n\n\n【Tips[]】\n\n- The Nemesis is  Intangible every other turn starting from the 2nd, giving the fight a clear tempo of attack and defend. The buff switches on/off right after Nemesis acts. All incoming damage (including  Poison and  Thorns) is reduced to 1 during the  Intangible turn. Players should generally avoid attacking while  Intangible is up, but applying  Poison or using power cards is recommended.\n- Nemesis' attacks do not increase in power through the fight, but without a source of Exhaust the player will eventually be overwhelmed with Burn cards, so they should take care not to let the fight last too long.\n- The Boot bypasses  Intangible's damage reduction, so all unblocked attack damage dealt will be increased to 5. This is not run-changing, but serves some use in this fight.\n- Judgment also ignores  Intangible and can finish off a severely damaged Nemesis.\n\n\n【Trivia[]】\n\n- Its resemblance to the Silent may mean that it is the Silent's \"Nemesis\", likely related to the text in the Sensory Stone event.\n- The Pagan imagery of both the Silent and Nemesis hint at ritualistic conflict.

If playing as the Ironclad, this can be countered by Evolve and/or Fire Breathing. Other characters can counter the Wounds by exhausting them or using the  Medical Kit relic.\n- If playing as the Silent, Piercing Wail is extremely useful, as all enemies will attack most turns. For other characters, Dark Shackles has a similar effect.\n- It may be best to kill the Red Slaver in the back first, so that he can't use his Entangle ability to prevent you from attacking. In addition, the  Vulnerable he applies is very dangerous when 3 enemies are attacking.\n- After killing the Red Slaver, it may be a good idea to kill the Blue Slaver next, as it applies  Weak, which will actively make your attacks less effective. However, on Ascension 18 and higher, it may be preferable to kill the Taskmaster earlier due to his  Strength gain.\n- A powerful card that damages all enemies such as Whirlwind, Immolate and Electrodynamics is extremely useful in this fight.\n\n\n【Update History[]】\n\n- Slay the Spire 1.0: Farewell Early Access\nColossuem Nob fight ordering swapped so that the Nob can apply Vulnerable.\n- Colossuem Nob fight ordering swapped so that the Nob can apply Vulnerable.\n- Weekly Patch 56: The Collector\nColosseum event's second fight is now a Gremlin Nob + Taskmaster (rather than 2 Gremlin Nobs)\n- Colosseum event's second fight is now a Gremlin Nob + Taskmaster (rather than 2 Gremlin Nobs)\n- Weekly Patch 5: Happy Holidays!\nTaskmaster's AI is reworked to be more straightforward.\n- Taskmaster's AI is reworked to be more straightforward.\n- Weekly Patch 2: Slimes!\nTaskmaster gets yet another nerf.\n- Taskmaster gets yet another nerf.\n- Weekly Patch 1: The First of Many!\nSlaver Boss now referred to as Taskmaster.\nTaskmaster now always uses Str up on turn 1 and his Whip attack is now a multi-hit with lower starting damage.\n- Slaver Boss now referred to as Taskmaster.\n- Taskmaster now always uses Str up on turn 1 and his Whip attack is now a multi-hit with lower starting damage.\n\n- Monsters,Elites, andBosses: Act I\n- Monsters,Elites, andBosses: Act II\n- Monsters,Elites, andBosses: ••••••\n- Monsters,Elites, andBosses: Act III\n- Monsters,Elites, andBosses: ••\n- Monsters,Elites, andBosses: Act IV"}]}

Has a 25% chance of using Soul Strike and a 75% chance of using Slash every turn. Slash cannot be used three times in a row and Soul Strike cannot be used twice in a row.\n\nOnce its HP reaches 0, it loses Curiosity and the intent instantly changes to Rebirth, then enters Phase 2.

Has a 50% chance of using Tackle and a 50% chance of using Sludge. Cannot use Tackle three times in a row and cannot use Sludge three times in a row.\n\nDefeating the Awakened One in Phase 2 will cause the remaining Cultists to flee.\n\n- Name: Dark Echo, Intent: , Effect: Deal 40 damage.\n- Name: Sludge, Intent: , Effect: Deal 18 damage and shuffle 1Voidinto the draw pile.\n- Name: Tackle, Intent: , Effect: Deal 10 x 3 damage.\n\n\n【Tips[]】\n\nThe Awakened One is designed to counter decks that utilize Power cards and decks that are designed to deal massive amounts of damage in one turn due to its Curiosity and Rebirth buffs. If your deck heavily relies on these strategies in Act 3, the fight may be more difficult than normal.\n\nKill the Cultists as soon as possible as they gain  Strength each turn after the first. The Awakened One itself is straightforward to handle: match your defense to the specific attack and use the rest of your energy to deal damage. Once you lower it to 0 HP, it will become invulnerable until its next turn while removing debuffs like weakened and vulnerable. Use that turn to ramp up your defense and possibly play power cards that were saved, since The Awakened One will immediately use its Dark Echo attack. Surviving Phase 2 is mostly a matter of surviving Dark Echo -- especially the first one, which could catch unsuspecting characters off-guard. Save any exhaust cards that will help speed up this phase (e.g. Terror).\n\nWatch out for Phase 1's Curiosity ability. Whenever you play a Power, the Awakened One will gain 1  Strength (2 in Ascension 19+). This is especially dangerous with the Soul Strike attack, which will use the  Strength bonus four times. Even if you have a Power build, you might want to avoid using them during this phase. Curiosity goes away in Phase 2, so you might want to spam your Powers when the Awakened One enters its invulnerable state between the phases, or as soon as Phase 2 begins.\n\nUse temporary  Strength debuffs (like Piercing Wail) right before killing his first form. The debuff will permanently lower  Strength in Phase 2, but not below 0.\n\n\n【Trivia[]】\n\n- The Awakened One is the deity that both the Cultists and the Chosen worship.\n- Matryoshka and  Eternal Feather reference this boss in their flavor text.\n- It is known that the Awakened One is the crow god Mazaleth according to the  Bird-Faced Urn's flavor text.\n- There is a Ritual Dagger stuck in the Awakened One's chest.\n- The Awakened One may be the end result of a ritual involving a lucky Chosen, as a way to manifest the deity they worship. Evidence to support this theory includes the the humanoid hands and body shape of the Awakened One, the name \"Chosen\", and the blue feathers that appear to be growing out of the body of the Chosen (in contrast to the Cultists, who appear to be only wearing clothes that mimic feathers). There is also the Ritual Dagger, which was used by worshippers of the deity in The Nest event, signaling that the body that houses the Awakened One was stabbed on purpose as part of a cult ritual.\n- If you kill the main Awakened One boss without killing the two cultists (both forms, over two turns), the cultists will run away, with the speech bubble \"Grr...\". Coincidentally (?), this is the same speech bubble the Awakened One uses when they transform.\n- Although the two Cultists in party with the Awakened One will run away when the Awakened One dies, they are not Minions and cards with the Fatal keyword will trigger when they are killed. This can be relevant if the Awakened One is the first Boss fought in Act 3 on Ascension 20, or if the player will continue to Act 4. Killing the first phase of the Awakened One will not trigger any Fatal effects, but will trigger on death effects such as Sunder.\n\n\n【Update History[]】\n\n- Patch V2.0: The Watcher\nFixed double-played Sunder gaining energy twice on Darklings and Awakened One.\n- Fixed double-played Sunder gaining energy twice on Darklings and Awakened One.\n- Weekly Patch 50: The Final Act\nAwakened One and Orb Walkers were not shuffling their status cards into the player's draw pile, but into a fixed position.\n- Awakened One and Orb Walkers were not shuffling their status cards into the player's draw pile, but into a fixed position.\n- Weekly Patch 46: Adrenaline\nFeed now correctly works on the Awakened One when it is in its second form.\n- Feed now correctly works on the Awakened One when it is in its second form.\n- Weekly Patch 42: Reboot\nUpdating SFX for Awakened One's pounce attack.\n- Updating SFX for Awakened One's pounce attack.\n- Weekly Patch 41: Chill\n2 more SFX for Awakened One's attacks.\n- 2 more SFX for Awakened One's attacks.\n- Weekly Patch 40: Forethought\nAscension 19 Awakened One's Curiousity Power nerfed 3 -> 2.\n- Ascension 19 Awakened One's Curiousity Power nerfed 3 -> 2.\n- Weekly Patch 35: Aggregate\nFix for crash when playing Havoc against half dead enemies (Darkling/Awakened one).\n- Fix for crash when playing Havoc against half dead enemies (Darkling/Awakened one).\n- Weekly Patch 34: Malaise\nEnemies in the Awakened One encounter were not attacking in the correct order.

{"conversations": [{"role": "user", "content": "What knowledge is there about 'Bosses' in Slay the Spire?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Bosses are incredibly difficult monsters that are encountered at the end of each Act. Compared to both normal monsters and elites, bosses typically sport a much higher health pool, much more damaging attacks, and utilize special gimmicks that either heavily cripple the player's deck or considerably buff themselves. Every boss has a unique portrait visible at the top of the Spire map, which can help plan a deck accordingly. The preceding map location will always be a Rest Site, allowing the player to heal before the fight; the only exception to this is the Corrupt Heart in Act 4 which always has a special elite encounter before it.\n\nOne boss is fought at the end of each Act. To advance to the next Act, the boss must successfully be defeated. At the end of Act 3, two bosses are fought in a row at Ascension 20.\n\nUpon defeating the Act 1 and Act 2 bosses, the player is rewarded with gold, a choice between three rare cards, a choice between three boss relics, and occasionally, a random potion. The Act 3 and Act 4 bosses do not award the player any consumables or cards. The player is also healed to full health (75% of missing health starting at Ascension 5) at the end of every boss battle.\n\nSlaying a boss will add 50 points to a run's score. Slaying a boss without taking damage, not including self-damaging cards such as Offering, adds an additional 50 points. Slaying all three bosses without taking any damage adds 200 points and overrides any previous flawlessness bonus.\n\nSome relics will activate during boss fights:\n\n- Pantograph will heal the player for 25 HP at the start of each boss combat.\n- Slaver's Collar will give the player an additional Energy at the start of their turn.\n\nConversely, relics such as the  Wing Boots cannot be used to skip boss fights, as all paths in an Act lead to the floor that contains the boss.\n\nDuring the Mind Bloom Event in Act 3, choosing the [I Am War] option starts a fight with a random Act 1 boss for a random rare relic. This boss fight does not add towards the run's score, but does activate the  Pantograph and  Slaver's Collar relics.\n\nThe Act 4 boss cannot be fought on the first playthrough of any character minus the Watcher. To fight the Act 4 boss, the player must defeat the Act 3 boss with the Ironclad, the Silent, and the Defect at least once.\n\n\n【Act 1[]】\n\nOne of these bosses will appear on Floor 16.\n\n\n【Act 2[]】\n\nOne of these bosses will appear on Floor 33.\n\n\n【Act 3[]】\n\nOne of these bosses will appear on Floor 50.

It is very powerful; its innate powers and buffs it gains throughout the fight can prove very difficult to counter. Because of its Invincible buff, it can only take 300 (200) damage per turn, rendering strategies that rely on heavy damage less effective. Additionally, it will gain incredible amounts of  Strength on its fourth buff and onward, so killing it quickly is also important.\n\n\n【Pattern[]】\n\nAlways starts with Debilitate. Uses Buff every 3 turns starting from turn 4.\n\nOtherwise, has a 50% chance of using Blood Shots followed by Echo and a 50% chance of using Echo followed by Blood Shots.\n\n- Name: Debilitate, Intent: , Effect: Applies 2Vulnerable, 2Weak, and 2Frailin that order.Shuffles aDazed,Slimed,Wound,Burnand aVoidinto the draw pile.\n- Name: Blood Shots, Intent: , Effect: Deal 2 x 12 damage.\n- Name: Echo, Intent: , Effect: Deal 40 damage.\n- Name: Buff, Intent: , Effect: Remove allStrength Downdebuffs, gain 2Strengthand additional buffs:1st Buff:Artifact22nd Buff:Beat of Death 13rd Buff:Painful Stabs4th Buff:Strength105th Buff onward:Strength50\n\n\n【Tips[]】\n\n- Strength reduction and/or damage reduction is very effective against The Heart, since its Blood Shots only deal 2 damage initially. This includes:\nPiercing Wail\nDark Shackles\nDisarm\nMalaise\n Torii\n- Piercing Wail\n- Dark Shackles\n- Disarm\n- Malaise\n- Torii\n- Do not use either of the first two cards in this list on a turn where The Heart buffs. It will clear the strength down debuff, then gain back the strength you made it lose from the card, essentially making you give The Heart free strength.\n- Any source of  Weak will also be extremely valuable against both of The Heart's attacks.\n- Sources of damage negation such as  Intangible and  Buffer can be very effective against the Echo attack.  Intangible is also reasonably useful against Blood Shots, as it will always lower the damage to 12 (15), whereas  Buffer would only negate 1 (2) of the attacks.\n Incense Burner is a source of  Intangible that can reliably block Blood Shots or Echo on turn two or three, if you end the Spire Shield and Spire Spear fight with it on 3 or 4. Because the attack pattern repeats every three turns, it will activate again on turn 9 or 10, during The Heart's third use of Blood Shots or Echo. Alternatively, it also works to set the relic to 0 or 1 to block the second and fourth cycles.\n- Incense Burner is a source of  Intangible that can reliably block Blood Shots or Echo on turn two or three, if you end the Spire Shield and Spire Spear fight with it on 3 or 4. Because the attack pattern repeats every three turns, it will activate again on turn 9 or 10, during The Heart's third use of Blood Shots or Echo. Alternatively, it also works to set the relic to 0 or 1 to block the second and fourth cycles.\n- Any effect that triggers on-damage or on-attack is very good against The Heart due to it triggering 12 (15) times for each Blood Shots that The Heart does. This includes:\n Thorns\nStatic Discharge\nFlame Barrier\n Self-Forming Clay\n- Thorns\n- Static Discharge\n- Flame Barrier\n- Self-Forming Clay\n- Medical Kit can be useful against The Heart, as it will allow you to remove the many statuses it will inflict on you, but beware of its Beat of Death power, as it will trigger whenever you play any card, including curses and statuses.\n- Tungsten Rod or After Image can completely negate Beat of Death 1. Both of these, 2 copies of After Image, or gaining  Intangible with either is necessary to negate Beat of Death 2, which is found on Ascension 19+ or applied on The Heart's second Buff action.\n- Mitigating the debuffs from Debilitate is important to take less damage in the first attack cycle. This includes:\n Artifact, with one stack negating  Vulnerable since it's applied first, and three negating all. Saving an  Ancient Potion is a strong option for this strategy.\n Turnip will prevent  Frail and  Odd Mushroom will reduce the effect of  Vulnerable, so buying the former in shops when possible and fighting the Fungi Beasts in the Hypnotizing Colored Mushrooms event can be worthwhile.\nWhile  Weak isn't a major problem if the goal is to block the first cycle,  Ginger will prevent it, which means that  Frail will be negated by a second stack of  Artifact since it's applied third. This is notable because Panacea+ provides two stacks, and so does an  Ancient Potion combined with  Sacred Bark.\n Clockwork Souvenir and  Orange Pellets, both shop-exclusive relics, provide very reliable ways to deal with these debuffs, so checking the rightmost relic slot in shops, where such relics are always found, for these and purchasing them is a priority.\nTo help trigger  Orange Pellets specifically on turn two or three, it's important to guarantee playing a power on those turns. This can be done by saving a  Power Potion for the turn or holding a power (especially an Innate or  Bottled one) in your hand by obtaining  Runic Pyramid or playing Well-Laid Plans or Equilibrium to  Retain it.\n- Artifact, with one stack negating  Vulnerable since it's applied first, and three negating all.

This is notable because Panacea+ provides two stacks, and so does an  Ancient Potion combined with  Sacred Bark.\n- Clockwork Souvenir and  Orange Pellets, both shop-exclusive relics, provide very reliable ways to deal with these debuffs, so checking the rightmost relic slot in shops, where such relics are always found, for these and purchasing them is a priority.\n- To help trigger  Orange Pellets specifically on turn two or three, it's important to guarantee playing a power on those turns. This can be done by saving a  Power Potion for the turn or holding a power (especially an Innate or  Bottled one) in your hand by obtaining  Runic Pyramid or playing Well-Laid Plans or Equilibrium to  Retain it.\n- Because Vault does not affect buffs on enemies, the Invincible damage cap is not reset for the extra turn.\n\n\n【Trivia[]】\n\n- An early version of this boss, which didn't make it past the playtesting phase around two years before it was released, used to deal 1 blockable damage per second instead of per card played.[1] This would make it the only timing-based gameplay mechanic outside of the Speed Climber Achievement and the Speedster and Lightspeed Scores.\n- Mental Fortress activates before Beat of Death for every Stance-changing card, except for Indignation, which will activate after.[2]\n\n\n【Update History[]】\n\n- Patch V2.0: The Watcher\nSlime and Heart enemy SFX no longer play when game is backgrounded.\n- Slime and Heart enemy SFX no longer play when game is backgrounded.\n- Patch V1.1: The Dealer\nFixed Invincible power with interactions such as The Boot and Block.\n- Fixed Invincible power with interactions such as The Boot and Block.\n- Weekly Patch 55: Blur\nAdding VFX for the Heart's buff move.\nAdding VFX for Heart's debuff move.\n- Adding VFX for the Heart's buff move.\n- Adding VFX for Heart's debuff move.\n- Weekly Patch 53: Blizzard\nBeat of Death Power now damages you after a card's actions completely resolve.\nInvincible Power tooltip now correctly matches the icon and shows the correct amount.\n- Beat of Death Power now damages you after a card's actions completely resolve.\n- Invincible Power tooltip now correctly matches the icon and shows the correct amount.\n\n- Monsters,Elites, andBosses: Act I\n- Monsters,Elites, andBosses: Act II\n- Monsters,Elites, andBosses: ••••••\n- Monsters,Elites, andBosses: Act III\n- Monsters,Elites, andBosses: ••\n- Monsters,Elites, andBosses: Act IV"}]}

Their consistent attack patterns make them easy to predict, but they attack every turn and their damage scales rapidly due to Donu's Circle of Power. Furthermore, their plated armor grants them a deceptive amount of HP over the course of the fight, while their initial Artifact charges grant them a degree of resistance against powerful cards like Bash and Piercing Wail.\n\nMost of the time, you should choose one of the two bosses to focus down before moving on to the other. Decks that cannot out-block the scaling damage from Circle of Power should typically kill Donu as quickly as possible. On the other hand, the Dazes that Deca shuffles into the discard pile can vastly slow down your draw as the fight wears on, particularly for decks lacking in card draw. These decks may prefer to kill Deca first.\n\n\n【Trivia[]】\n\n- By killing Donu with Feed, the player gets the \"Ooh Donut\" achievement.\n- Despite Deca's name, Deca is an octahedron.\n\n\n【Update History[]】\n\n- Weekly Patch 42: Reboot\nUpdating SFX for Donu Buff.\n- Updating SFX for Donu Buff.\n- Weekly Patch 41: Chill\nAdding SFX to Donu's buff.\n- Adding SFX to Donu's buff.\n- Weekly Patch 32: Face Trader\nDonu and Deca now alternate their attacks on turn 2.\n- Donu and Deca now alternate their attacks on turn 2.\n- Weekly Patch 14: Bullet Time\nNew animations for Donu & Deca.\nSwapped Donu & Deca's positions so the attack order is left -> right.\n- New animations for Donu & Deca.\n- Swapped Donu & Deca's positions so the attack order is left -> right.\n- Weekly Patch 7: Setting Up All the Things\nFixing typo for Donu & Deca achievement description.\n- Fixing typo for Donu & Deca achievement description.\n- Weekly Patch 4: Full speed ahead!\nPantograph no longer heals double on Donu and Deca boss.\n- Pantograph no longer heals double on Donu and Deca boss.\n\n- Monsters,Elites, andBosses: Act I\n- Monsters,Elites, andBosses: Act II\n- Monsters,Elites, andBosses: ••••••\n- Monsters,Elites, andBosses: Act III\n- Monsters,Elites, andBosses: ••\n- Monsters,Elites, andBosses: Act IV"}]}

After this, each of its attacks lights one green flame. Once there are six flames, it will use Inferno, and then snuff out all flames. The attack pattern, and the number of flames on that move, are as follows:\n\n- 0. Sear\n- 1. Tackle\n- 2. Sear\n- 3. Inflame\n- 4. Tackle\n- 5. Sear\n- 6. Inferno\n\nAfter it has used its first Inferno attack, Sear will give the player Burn+ card instead of the regular Burn. This deals 4 damage instead of 2.\n\n- Name: Activate, Intent: , Effect: Nothing.\n- Name: Divider, Intent: , Effect: Deals (H+1) x 6 damage.

The damage after the initial Divider is minor, but over time the combination of Inflame with accumulating burn cards will overwhelm you. Surviving the Hexaghost is often a matter of killing it before Inferno hits or as quickly as possible after.\n- Cards and relics which exhaust, transform, or otherwise utilize status cards can significantly reduce the challenge of this battle. Examples: Storm of Steel, Evolve, Fiend Fire,  Medical Kit.\n- It is actually practical to enter this fight with low health, as Divider attack scales with your current health. The lower your health is, the easier to block damage from Divider attack. Consider foregoing resting at a Rest Site prior to this boss.\n- With it utilizing barrages of low-damage attack and slow scaling,  Weak,  Thorns, and strength reduction (such as Disarm, Dark Shackles, or Malaise) are invaluable.\n\n\n【Trivia[]】\n\n- Similar to the Guardian's \"DESTROY DESTROY DESTROY,\" and Slime Boss's \"Slime...

The same strategy applies to the smaller slimes when they split.\n\n\n【Trivia[]】\n\n- The name “Slime Boss” is a parody of “Crime Boss” due to the fact that this boss has a Mafia-style hat and also splits into other slimes, a reference to the elusive and neverending nature of mob families.\n\n\n【Gallery[]】\n\n\n【Update History[]】\n\n- Patch V2.0: The Watcher\nSlime and Heart enemy SFX no longer play when game is backgrounded.\n- Slime and Heart enemy SFX no longer play when game is backgrounded.\n- Patch V1.1: The Dealer\nFixed enemy order issues in Slime Boss, Gremlin Leader, and Reptomancer encounters.\n- Fixed enemy order issues in Slime Boss, Gremlin Leader, and Reptomancer encounters.\n- Weekly Patch 42: Reboot\nUpdating SFX for Slimed Attack.\n- Updating SFX for Slimed Attack.\n- Weekly Patch 40: Forethought\nAcid Slime (Large) and Slime Boss get additional slime attack SFX.\n- Acid Slime (Large) and Slime Boss get additional slime attack SFX.\n- Weekly Patch 21: Channel Lightning\nSlimes no longer make sounds if game is running in background and bg sounds are muted.\n- Slimes no longer make sounds if game is running in background and bg sounds are muted.\n- Weekly Patch 18: Paranormal\nSlime Boss nerf: 3 Slime attack no longer deals damage.\n- Slime Boss nerf: 3 Slime attack no longer deals damage.\n- Weekly Patch 17: Patched in the Face\nSlimed: Replaces Wounds and Draw Reduction debuff from Slime enemies.\nSeveral Slime enemies now give you Slimed rather than a debuff.\n- Slimed: Replaces Wounds and Draw Reduction debuff from Slime enemies.\n- Several Slime enemies now give you Slimed rather than a debuff.\n- Weekly Patch 16: Back to Work\nSplit Slimes and other spawned minions should now correctly have the Slow power when Time Dilation mod is on.\n- Split Slimes and other spawned minions should now correctly have the Slow power when Time Dilation mod is on.\n- Weekly Patch 5: Happy Holidays!\nMeat on the Bone, Red Skull, Slime's Split, and Berserk all trigger on less than or equal to 50% HP and desc are updated to reflect this\n- Meat on the Bone, Red Skull, Slime's Split, and Berserk all trigger on less than or equal to 50% HP and desc are updated to reflect this\n- Weekly Patch 2: Slimes!\nSlime Boss gets a minor nerf.\nFixed bug where defeating Slime Boss wasn't giving achievement.\n- Slime Boss gets a minor nerf.\n- Fixed bug where defeating Slime Boss wasn't giving achievement.\n\n- Monsters,Elites, andBosses: Act I\n- Monsters,Elites, andBosses: Act II\n- Monsters,Elites, andBosses: ••••••\n- Monsters,Elites, andBosses: Act III\n- Monsters,Elites, andBosses: ••\n- Monsters,Elites, andBosses: Act IV"}]}

On all other turns, has:\n\n- 15% chance to Defensive Stance\n- 15% chance to Gloat\n- 25% chance to Face Slap\n- 45% chance to Heavy Slash\n\nMoves cannot be used twice in a row: If the previous move would be repeated, the move that comes after it in the list above is selected instead. For example, if the previous move was Gloat, there is now a 0% chance of Gloat and a 40% chance of Face Slap with all the other probabilities unchanged.\n\nIf Heavy Slash is used, its probability chance is added to Face Slap instead of Defensive Stance.\n\nOn Ascension 19+, he will use Defensive Stance instead of Gloat. Defensive Stance can be cast at most twice per battle and subsequent casts are instead Gloats, regardless of ascension.\n\nWhen HP drops below 50%, he will use Anger next turn and enter Phase 2.\n\n\n【Phase 2[]】\n\nAfter using Anger, will use Execute immediately.\n\nFor the next two turns, selects random moves (same exact behavior as in Phase 1), then Executes again. Repeats this pattern (2 random moves, then Execute).\n\n- Name: Defensive Stance, Intent: , Effect: Gains 15Blockand 5Metallicize.\n- Name: Face Slap, Intent: , Effect: Deals 12 damage, applying 2Frailand 2Vulnerable.\n- Name: Taunt, Intent: , Effect: Applies 2Weakand 2Vulnerable.\n- Name: Heavy Slash, Intent: , Effect: Deals 16 damage.\n- Name: Gloat, Intent: , Effect: Gains 2Strength.\n- Name: Execute, Intent: , Effect: Deals 10 x 2 damage.\n- Name: Anger, Intent: , Effect: Removes all debuffs, gains 6Strength.\n\n\n【Tips[]】\n\nOnce the Champ uses his Phase 2 attacks, his strength will be very high, making his attacks do significantly more damage. Combined with the  Frail and  Vulnerable debuffs, the fight can quickly become very dangerous. Execute is a deadly attack; it can end up dealing damage in the twenties 2 times.\n\nGenerally, you want to spend the first half of the fight setting up, and then you want to very quickly kill the Champ once his HP drops below half.\n\nTaunt is used on turn 4. Both Anger and Execute (from Phase 2) will override Taunt, letting you avoid the  Weak debuff if you get his health below half of his max HP on turns 3 or 4. If you cannot burst this quickly (most decks cannot), avoid getting him angry on turns 5 and 6, as the weak effect makes it difficult for you burst properly through Phase 2, and likely means you will eat another Execute.\n\n\n【Trivia[]】\n\n- The Champ is the owner of the  Champion Belt, a Rare Relic for the Ironclad, and will recognize if you have it. He will say, \"THATS MY BELT!!\"\n\n\n【Gallery[]】\n\n\n【Update History[]】\n\n- Patch V2.0: The Watcher\nChamp boss now recognizes if you have  his belt.\n- Champ boss now recognizes if you have  his belt.\n- Weekly Patch 50: The Final Act\nThe Champ's sword attacks get VFX.\n- The Champ's sword attacks get VFX.\n- Weekly Patch 42: Reboot\nUpdating SFX for Champ charging up.\nUpdating SFX for Champ Slap.\n- Updating SFX for Champ charging up.\n- Updating SFX for Champ Slap.\n- Weekly Patch 41: Chill\nAdding SFX for Champ's Slap.\nChamp gets a new SFX when charging up.\n- Adding SFX for Champ's Slap.\n- Champ gets a new SFX when charging up.\n- Weekly Patch 40: Forethought\nAscension 19 Champ Strength buff nerfed 5 -> 4.\n- Ascension 19 Champ Strength buff nerfed 5 -> 4.\n- Weekly Patch 37: Darkness\nChamp boss' Execute attack nerf: 7x3 -> 10x2.\nChamp boss' Slap attack buff: 10 -> 12 (Asc: 12 -> 14).\nChamp boss' Slash attack buff: 15 -> 16 (Asc: 16 -> 18).\n- Champ boss' Execute attack nerf: 7x3 -> 10x2.\n- Champ boss' Slap attack buff: 10 -> 12 (Asc: 12 -> 14).\n- Champ boss' Slash attack buff: 15 -> 16 (Asc: 16 -> 18).\n- Weekly Patch 16: Back to Work\nChamp has less randomness in his AI after enraging.

Also note that the damage done by Sharp Hide can be blocked, so don't be too afraid to attack.\n\nSharp Hide works similarly to  Thorns, except it activates when you play attack cards, not when you hit the enemy.

Most decks will have an easy time simply focusing on doing as much direct damage as possible, so it will be interrupted just before it would release a Fierce Bash or Whirlwind. Manage your cards so you will have lots of damage during Offensive Mode and some  Block during Defensive Mode so you don't get damaged as much if you want to attack while it has  Thorns.\n\nPoison will proc mode shift and avoid thorns, and as such is very effective against this boss.\n\n\n【Gallery[]】\n\n\n【Update History[]】\n\n- Weekly Patch 42: Reboot\nAdding SFX for Whirlwind card + Guardian enemy.\nUpdating SFX for Guardian Destroy dialog.\nUpdating SFX for Whirlwind (card AND Guardian enemy).\n- Adding SFX for Whirlwind card + Guardian enemy.\n- Updating SFX for Guardian Destroy dialog.\n- Updating SFX for Whirlwind (card AND Guardian enemy).\n- Weekly Patch 40: Forethought\nAdded SFX when the Guardian says Destroy Destroy Destroy.\n- Added SFX when the Guardian says Destroy Destroy Destroy.\n- Weekly Patch 38: Bane\nThe Guardian boss' Phase Shift is now 35 starting Ascension 9.\n- The Guardian boss' Phase Shift is now 35 starting Ascension 9.\n- Weekly Patch 13: Thinking Ahead\nIf damage type is thorns, then the damage is dealt even if the owner is dead (Spiker/Guardian).\n- If damage type is thorns, then the damage is dealt even if the owner is dead (Spiker/Guardian).\n- Weekly Patch 12: Lunar New Year\nThe Guardian boss gets +20 HP.\n- The Guardian boss gets +20 HP.\n- Weekly Patch 10: Quality of Life\nFixed issue where thorns would secretly affect ModeShift for TheGuardian.\n- Fixed issue where thorns would secretly affect ModeShift for TheGuardian.\n- Weekly Patch 5: Happy Holidays!\nGuardian boss buff.

The player should take special care to ensure that they can play an appropriate number of cards each turn.\nThe Time Eater punishes decks that play many cards per turn, such as infinite or Shiv decks, especially hard. If you are relying heavily on this deck type in Act 3, it may be worth reconsidering your strategy.\nPlaying a consistent number of cards per turn may be useful so that Time Warp does not limit you to a one-card turn. For example, it's usually preferable to play 4 cards, then 5, then 3, rather than 7 cards, then 4, then 1.\n- The Time Eater punishes decks that play many cards per turn, such as infinite or Shiv decks, especially hard.

For example, it's usually preferable to play 4 cards, then 5, then 3, rather than 7 cards, then 4, then 1.\n- Try to avoid using low-cost, spammable cards when you can. These cards will quickly increment the Time Warp ability and Time Eater will gain too much strength to be dealt with.\nAs an example, if you were to play Acrobatics, draw 1 Strike+ and 1 Defend+, and play them both, it would cost 3 Time Warp charges. A single Dash+ would give roughly the same block and damage for the same amount of energy, but only 1 Time Warp charge.\n- As an example, if you were to play Acrobatics, draw 1 Strike+ and 1 Defend+, and play them both, it would cost 3 Time Warp charges. A single Dash+ would give roughly the same block and damage for the same amount of energy, but only 1 Time Warp charge.\n\n- Time Eater can only use Haste once and will always use Haste the turn after falling below half HP. Since Haste erases all debuffs and heals the Time Eater back to half HP, there is no reason to take offensive action once the Time Eater is below half HP unless you can kill the Time Eater in one turn. It is better to play Powers and buff yourself for the remaining battle when possible.\nDue to the fact that the heal can be reliably activated, it may be worth ending the turn with Time Warp close to 12 if it lets you get the Time Eater below half HP, as you can safely play only one or two cards next turn while he heals, resetting the timer.\nThe heal action will remove the debuffs from Piercing Wail and Dark Shackles and their \"buffs\" (regaining  Strength), causing Time Eater to permanently lose any  Strength it had before.\nThe debuff cleanse from Haste can be challenging for certain decks, such as slow-ramping Poison decks. Plan accordingly.\n- Due to the fact that the heal can be reliably activated, it may be worth ending the turn with Time Warp close to 12 if it lets you get the Time Eater below half HP, as you can safely play only one or two cards next turn while he heals, resetting the timer.\n- The heal action will remove the debuffs from Piercing Wail and Dark Shackles and their \"buffs\" (regaining  Strength), causing Time Eater to permanently lose any  Strength it had before.\n- The debuff cleanse from Haste can be challenging for certain decks, such as slow-ramping Poison decks. Plan accordingly.\n- The Watcher can nullify Time Warp by playing Vault as the twelfth card. The result is the same as if you had normally played a Vault card and the Time Warp counter is reset.\n- Playing Omniscience as the 12th card (from hand or during an Omniscience chain) can bypass the card limit. However, it must be played as the 12th card, playing Omniscience as the 11th card cannot bypass the card limit unless another Omniscience is selected to be the 12th card play, see Omniscience wiki page for more information.\n- If the 12th card play triggers a card select menu, and the player uses  Distilled Chaos before closing the menu, then  Distilled Chaos can bypass the card limit before being forced to end the turn (this is especially powerful with Scrying cards since they can manipulate which cards are being played by  Distilled Chaos). Note that if the card draws, then the card draw happens before  Distilled Chaos; The \"Disabled confirmation when choosing 1 card\" preference setting could stop this from working when there is only 1 card available to choose from. The list of all cards that triggers a card select menu is: Headbutt, Armaments (not upgraded), True Grit (upgraded), Warcry, Burning Pact, Dual Wield, Exhume, Survivor, Dagger Throw, Acrobatics, Prepared, Concentrate, Setup, Nightmare, Hologram, Recycle, Seek, Cut Through Fate, Just Lucky, Third Eye, Foreign Influence, Meditate, Omniscience, Wish, Discovery, Forethought, Purity, Secret Technique, Secret Weapon, Thinking Ahead.\n\n\n【Trivia[]】\n\n- It is possible that the Time Eater is related to the Watcher in some way. Their attires are different shades of purple and adorned with a similar motif. It also says \"Never... Liked... You...\" on its first turn when facing the Watcher, instead of the usual \"Ah... company.\"\nThe Watcher's Sensory Stone text implies that her peer went missing and stopped reporting back to their sect about the Spire. Time Eater might be that missing peer of hers.\n- The Watcher's Sensory Stone text implies that her peer went missing and stopped reporting back to their sect about the Spire.

However, its high energy cost means you can not put up a defense without some additional source of energy, and its applications with Double Tap are more limited. Bludgeon is more helpful against the low health of Act 1 enemies, and is very useful for them if obtained early, as it can finish encounters early with no risk for retaliation.  Snecko Eye is great with Bludgeon, as having an average energy cost of 1.5 makes it have much better value."}]}

When Upgraded, Dual Wield creates 2 copies of the selected card instead of 1.\n\n\n【Mechanics[]】\n\n- All characteristics of the selected card are copied. When copying a card with altered Energy cost or altered text, such as those related to Madness,  Confused, Rampage, and Blood for Blood, the modifications are also copied.\n- If the player's hand is full, the copied card(s) is sent to the discard pile.\n- Copied cards only exist during the combat that Dual Wield is played, and will not carry over after the combat is finished.\n\n\n【Tips[]】\n\n- Any mechanic which creates 0-cost cards that are normally expensive can be very powerful with dual wield as the copies also cost 0. Potions that do this are power, attack and liquid memories. Relics include Mummified Hand and cards include Discovery, Infernal Blade, Madness and more.\n\n- Duel Wield can copy powerful self-Exhausting cards like Feed and Pummel so they can be played repeatedly, or copy Powers to stack their effects. Consider discarding the copy instead of playing it, so that it can be copied more when drawn again.\n- Copies of Searing Blow will remain Upgraded, so Dual Wield works well when creating copies of a highly-Upgraded Searing Blow.\n\n- Dual Wield doesn't Exhaust itself, allowing the player to repeatedly copy the same card. By Exhausting undesired cards with True Grit and similar cards, the player can create a deck containing nothing but a single powerful card or combo.\n\n- Copying a \"Strike\" card with Dual Wield increases the power of Perfected Strike. Perfected Strike itself is a \"Strike\" card, so making copies of Perfected Strike makes them all more powerful.\n\n- Prioritize copying key cards as quickly as possible, as having more copies makes it more likely to draw that card and Dual Wield again on future turns.\n\n\n【Update History[]】\n\n- Weekly Update 40: Forethought\nCard copy effects like Dual Wield should now also copy the \"free to play once\" effect from cards like Setup and Forethought.\n- Card copy effects like Dual Wield should now also copy the \"free to play once\" effect from cards like Setup and Forethought.\n- Weekly Patch 12: Lunar New Year\nCopying cards from effects like Dual Wield now correctly displays cost as green if modified.\n- Copying cards from effects like Dual Wield now correctly displays cost as green if modified.\n- Weekly Patch 8: Ooh Shiny!\nDual Wield card is now Uncommon (was Common).\n- Dual Wield card is now Uncommon (was Common).\n- Weekly Patch 3: Balance Balance Balance\nDual Wield now properly works on ONLY Attacks and Powers as worded.\n- Dual Wield now properly works on ONLY Attacks and Powers as worded.\n- Weekly Patch 2: Slimes!\nDual Wield can no longer duplicate skills, stopping the easy infinites.\n- Dual Wield can no longer duplicate skills, stopping the easy infinites.\n- Weekly Patch 1: The First of Many!\nDual Wield Card reworked and buffed.\n- Dual Wield Card reworked and buffed."}]}

It grants 2 Energy and 3 card draws, in return for 6 HP. As a Rare card, it can be obtained after defeating a Boss.\n\nUpgrading Offering increases the number of cards drawn from 3 to 5.\n\n\n【Strategy[]】\n\n- Offering causes HP loss, not damage, and is not reduced by  Block. The life loss downside is mitigated by the Ironclad's  Burning Blood.\n\n- The life-loss effect will trigger  Runic Cube, adding an additional draw.\n- Offering can also trigger Rupture for  Strength gain.\n\n- Offering is exceptionally strong in decks loaded with one- and zero-cost Attacks. In particular, Anger loads your deck with free Attacks, and Bite recovers the HP loss. Adding a Panache stacks up lots of bonus area-of-effect damage.\n\n- Combining Offering with  Unceasing Top massively increases both of their strength. The Top provides extra cards to spend surplus Energy from Offering, prolonging the chain of free draws. With a few Angers shuffled into the deck, a few Seeing Red, and a few points of  Strength, turns with hundreds of damage can be executed pretty reliably.\n\n- Offering also provides the Energy needed to execute expensive combos like Impervious + 2 Entrenches + Body Slam.\n\n- While the life loss is a relevant cost, the player should consider that enemies attack most turns. Unless the deck is extremely defensive, ending the combat a turn or two earlier could easily prevent six or more damage.\n\n- Many enemies, particularly bosses, use weak attacks and Debuffs for a few turns before executing an overwhelmingly strong finishing move. Offering enables the player to beat the clock and slay the foe before it can perform the coup de grace.\n\n\n【Update History[]】\n\n- Patch V1.1: The Dealer\nOffering card is now faster in Fast Mode.\n- Offering card is now faster in Fast Mode.\n- Weekly Patch 46: Adrenaline\nAdding VFX for Offering card.\n- Adding VFX for Offering card.\n- Weekly Patch 37: Darkness\nOffering card nerf: HP Loss increased from 5 -> 6.\n- Offering card nerf: HP Loss increased from 5 -> 6.\n- Weekly Patch 34: Malaise\nOffering card nerf: Self damage increased from 4 -> 5.\n- Offering card nerf: Self damage increased from 4 -> 5.\n- Weekly Patch 31: Custom Mode\nOptional UPGRADE_DESCRIPTION added for Pummel, Heavy Blade, Offering, and Reprogram\n- Optional UPGRADE_DESCRIPTION added for Pummel, Heavy Blade, Offering, and Reprogram\n- Weekly Patch 27: Hello World\nFixed issue where playing cost X cards quickly after energy gain cards failed.

It deals 6 damage plus 2 for every card with \"Strike\" in its name in the player's draw pile, discard pile, and hand. As a Common card, it can be found as a reward after combats.\n\nUpgrading Perfected Strike increases the damage bonus for each \"Strike\" from 2 to 3.\n\nThe bonus damage is added to the base damage of the card, and all the damage is dealt in one shot, meaning strength bonuses are applied only once and not multiple times. In combat, the first line of the card's text is updated to reflect the additional damage.\n\nEach copy of Perfected Strike counts itself as a \"Strike\".\n\n- Perfected Strike\n- Pommel Strike\n- Strike\n- Twin Strike\n- Wild Strike\n- Swift Strike\n\nIn game modes where you have access to cards of every color, it additionally counts:\n\n- The Defect's Strike\n- The Silent's Strike\n- The Watcher's Strike\n- Sneaky Strike\n- Thunder Strike\n- Meteor Strike\n- Windmill Strike\n\n\n【Strategy[]】\n\n- Perfected Strike is one of the most powerful Attacks in early Ironclad decks. Simply dropping one into the starting deck deals 18 damage without an upgrade, and it only increases from there.\n\n- Picking Perfected Strikes early is a reliable strategy. Not only are they strong on their own, but their power grows over time as more Perfected Strikes and other \"Strike\" cards are obtained.\n\n- As a Common, the card is often sold by the Merchant at a low price, so players looking to build a Strike deck should pick routes that include his carpet.\n\n- When packing Perfected Strikes, avoid the Vampires(?) Event and  Pandora's Box Relic, since this will remove your starting Strikes and reduce the card's power.\n\n- Changing the total number of \"Strike\" cards in your deck, discard pile, and hand during combat affects Perfected Strike's additional damage. This means that its power decreases when \"Strikes\" are Exhausted or put in Stasis by Bronze Orbs, and increases when \"Strikes\" are created by Dual Wield.\n- Strike Dummy pairs well with Perfected Strike, as it boosts the damage of Perfected Strike and all the other Strike cards used to boost Perfected Strike.\n\n\n【Update History[]】\n\n- Weekly Patch 28: The Ritual\nFixed issue where Strike (blue), Thunder Strike, and Meteor Strike weren't used by Perfected Strike.\n- Fixed issue where Strike (blue), Thunder Strike, and Meteor Strike weren't used by Perfected Strike.\n- Weekly Patch 18: Paranormal\nPerfected Strike now counts Strikes from other characters.\n- Perfected Strike now counts Strikes from other characters.\n- Weekly Patch 1: The First of Many!\nClarified Perfected Strike's wording for new functionality.\nPerfected Strike gets an updated description.\nPerfected Strike reworked.

Heal HP equal to unblocked damage.Exhaust.\n\n\nReaper+\n\nCost+\n2\n\n\nEffect+\nDeal 5 damage to ALL enemies. Heal HP equal to unblocked damage.Exhaust.\n\n\n\nReaper is a Rare Attack card for the Ironclad. It deals 4 damage to all enemies, then heals the player for the combined HP lost by the enemies. Upgrading Reaper increases the damage dealt per enemy from 4 to 5.\n\n\n【Interactions[]】\n\n- Because the health restored is based on the damage dealt, anything that increases damage, including  Vulnerable,  Strength buffs, Relics, Stances, and upgrading Reaper will increase the amount of health restored.\nSimilarly, effects that reduce damage, such as Weak or enemy Buffs, will reduce the health restored.\n- Similarly, effects that reduce damage, such as Weak or enemy Buffs, will reduce the health restored.\n- Reaper restores health equal to the HP the enemy loses. For instance, dealing 4 damage to an enemy with 1 HP will only restore one point of health, and blocked damage is not healed.\n- The heal from Reaper applies after taking damage from  Thorns and  Sharp Hide, and cannot be used to avoid death by these effects.\n- As a healing card, Reaper cannot be created by Infernal Blade or Metamorphosis.\n- Due to its long animation requiring the red orbs needing to touch the character, using Reaper as a finishing blow against certain enemies that have fast death animations and/or are in spots farther away from the character can sometimes cause the reward screen to show up and the battle to end before the healing is able to work.\n\n\n【Strategy[]】\n\n- Reaper is a clunky card - not only is it situational, but it's expensive at 2 Energy. When playing a deck with Reaper, take care not to get too greedy. It's easy to make poor plays in the hope that Reaper will restore more health in the future. At the same time, however, Reaper can also be one of the most powerful cards in the entire game. With enough Strength gain, Reaper can gain an incredible amount of health each fight.\n\n- In fights with one or two enemies, it's usually advisable to play Reaper as soon as possible to avoid drawing it in the future. With more enemies, you can hold out longer, but be careful - wait too long, and you may need to kill the enemy you had hoped to drain.\n\n- In general, you should play Reaper as soon as enemies give you an opening unless you'll lose more HP that turn by using it than by blocking, or you have a reliable way of gaining large amounts of Strength, such as Demon Form or an upgraded Limit Break.\n\n- Reaper is generally not worth spending a Smith action to upgrade - it only increases the damage by 1, which usually translates to at most 3-5 extra damage/health.\n\n\n【Synergies[]】\n\n- Reaper performs well with cards that inflict  Vulnerable, which sharply increases the amount of health restored.\n\n- Reaper's best friends are  Strength buffs. Not only does  Strength increase the amount of Health restored, but you don't need to worry about timing it like you would with Vulnerable.\n\n- Reaper is an excellent utility for self-damaging decks, especially ones with Rupture. It gives you more health in mid-battle, allowing the usually short-lived deck to effectively fight longer battles against bosses.\n\n- Consider combining it with Dual Wield or Double Tap to maximize its potential.\n\n- Strange Spoon can be a double-edged sword - more plays means more HP, but the card's utility generally decreases with the number of enemies and less empty health to heal.\n\n\n【Update History[]】\n\n- Patch V1.1: The Dealer\nImproved lifesteal logic for Reaper and Shelled Parasite.\n- Improved lifesteal logic for Reaper and Shelled Parasite.\n- Weekly Patch 55: Blur\nReaper card now heals the correct amount if the player has The Boot relic.\nAdding VFX for Reaper card.\n- Reaper card now heals the correct amount if the player has The Boot relic.\n- Adding VFX for Reaper card.\n- Weekly Patch 44: Chrysalis\nAll sources of random temporary card generation in combat (like Dead Branch) can no longer generate cards that provide healing.\nNew tip added to indicate that healing cards cannot be generated randomly during combat.\n- All sources of random temporary card generation in combat (like Dead Branch) can no longer generate cards that provide healing.\n- New tip added to indicate that healing cards cannot be generated randomly during combat.\n- Weekly Patch 6: We're Back!\nReaper now heals as part of the attack now, not after (you heal before thorns hit you).\n- Reaper now heals as part of the attack now, not after (you heal before thorns hit you)."}]}

Although on the surface it may seem to be no better than a card like Backflip, it synergizes very well with cards whose effects trigger upon being discarded (e.g. Tactician, Reflex), or who have additional effects if other cards have been discarded (e.g. Sneaky Strike, Eviscerate). It also allows you discard Curses, Statuses, or cards that aren't useful on a given turn.\nThe upgrade for Acrobatics is relatively powerful, as it provides a net gain of 3 cards instead of 2. In addition to the obvious benefits of additional card draw, this also means that you have more options for cards to discard.\n- The upgrade for Acrobatics is relatively powerful, as it provides a net gain of 3 cards instead of 2. In addition to the obvious benefits of additional card draw, this also means that you have more options for cards to discard.\n- In general, drawing 3 cards sounds very meritable, but this is usually only true in the later part of the game. Early on, when you only have 3 Energy, it is rarely reasonable to spend 1 energy purely to draw cards, since you still need energy to play the cards that you draw.\nReusable cards that provide energy can help improve the effectiveness of Acrobatics early on.

It inflicts No Draw status on the player, preventing them from drawing any cards for the rest of the turn, and all cards in hand have their costs reduced to 0 Energy.\n\nWhen Upgraded, Bullet Time costs 2 Energy instead of 3.\n\n\n【Mechanics[]】\n\n- The No Draw status can be negated by  Artifact, or removed with  Orange Pellets.\n- No Draw only prevents you from drawing cards from your deck; it will not prevent you from generating cards via e.g. the  Dead Branch or Shiv-creating cards.\n\n\n【Strategy[]】\n\n- Taking full advantage of Bullet Time requires more thought and effort than it might seem at first. The key thing to remember is that Bullet Time itself takes up a slot in any hand you draw it into, and does nothing but let you play the remaining cards. Furthermore, unlike with generic energy-gain cards, cards that draw other cards must be played before Bullet Time itself.\n- If you're just drawing five cards a turn, Bullet Time will let you play four of them; if you already have an Energy relic, and most of your cards cost 1 or 0, Bullet Time will be completely useless (no better than a Curse) every time it's drawn. For it to be useful, the total cost of the other cards worth playing in your hand has to be higher than your Energy limit. In a normal deck that hasn't been intentionally built around it, this happens less frequently than you would expect.\nAlternatively, instead of running a high-cost deck, you must at least ensure you have enough card-draw effects that you can use before Bullet Time consistently, specifically Acrobatics or Backflip. This requires 4 Energy or Bullet Time+. Other draws such as Prepared or Tools of the Trade aren't necessarily sufficient, since they don't give a net positive in the amount of cards you get. Escape Plan only replaces itself and may grant some  Block, but does not increase the number of cards in your hand.\n- Alternatively, instead of running a high-cost deck, you must at least ensure you have enough card-draw effects that you can use before Bullet Time consistently, specifically Acrobatics or Backflip.

Escape Plan only replaces itself and may grant some  Block, but does not increase the number of cards in your hand.\n- As a result of this, the decks that want Bullet Time are ones with lots of high-cost cards and few cards that cost 0 or even 1. It's also more valuable if you've made it to the late game and still haven't found any suitable Energy relics, forcing you to accomplish as much as you can with your starting 3.\n- Curses and Statuses can weaken Bullet Time further; any deck that uses it is going to be vulnerable to them.\n\n\n【Synergies[]】\n\n- Bullet Time is extremely useful with the  Snecko Eye, since the extra draw and random costs increase the chance that it will let you play more than you could have otherwise. It also provides a degree of protection from bad cost rolls, since you'll always be able to play Bullet Time if you draw it, thereby enabling you to play all the other cards in your hand. The Snecko Eye will often reduce Bullet Time's cost below 3 Energy as well, meaning that there may still be spare Energy for drawing more cards before using Bullet Time.\n- Since Bullet Time makes all Attacks cost 0, the  Wrist Blade will make them stronger.\n- The  Runic Pyramid can keep cards that weren't played during a turn to fill up a hand to play with Bullet Time.\n\n\n【Update History[]】\n\n- Patch V2.0: The Watcher\nFixed Escape Plan gaining Block when card drawn is blocked by No Draw power.\n- Fixed Escape Plan gaining Block when card drawn is blocked by No Draw power.\n- Weekly Patch 33: Terror\nNo Draw power now counts as a debuff.\n- No Draw power now counts as a debuff.\n- Weekly Patch 5: Happy Holidays!\nBullet Time now affects all cards currently in hand, works with Madness, and no longer applies a Power to you.\n- Bullet Time now affects all cards currently in hand, works with Madness, and no longer applies a Power to you."}]}

So, an enemy with one artifact will only block poison.\n- The \"Corpse Explosion\" effect lasts indefinitely (unless the enemy clears its debuffs).\n- The fatal damage can come from any source--it does not have to come from Poison.\n- It can stack, allowing an enemy to deal two or more times its max HP to all foes.\n- Because the poison and explosion damage is dealt after  Block is removed, very few enemies can block it.\n- Corpse Explosion does trigger when Reptomancer's Daggers automatically die on their second turn.\n\n\n【Strategy[]】\n\nCorpse Explosion is an exceptionally strong card when fighting multiple enemies. Even without the above-average amount of Poison, it can inflict massive amounts of area-of-effect damage and easily clear boards.\n\nAs a Poison enabler, it's strong but clunky. 9 Poison is the single largest printed amount of Poison, but two Energy is a big investment. Consider it a step up from Bouncing Flask in most situations.\n\nA key decision when casting Corpse Explosion is whether to target an enemy with low HP to wipe it off the board earlier, or to target the enemy with the highest max HP to wipe the entire board at once. Generally, targeting the beefiest enemy and then focusing all of your attacks on it is the optimal play, though if a shuffle is imminent, it may be smarter to pick a weaker enemy and try to stack the effect again.\n\nCorpse Explosion is an excellent workhorse for defensive decks. The Poison cuts through Block while the explosion scales the damage up, allowing you to fully focus on defense. It also negates up to two  artifacts because of its two effects (poison and apply poison upon death).\n\nUpgrading Corpse Explosion is recommended to increase its potency against single enemies.\n\n\n【Synergies[]】\n\n- Burst allows Corpse Explosion to apply a huge amount of Poison and area-of-effect damage.\n- Corpse Explosion triggers Sadistic Nature twice.\n- The card synergizes with all Poison-matters cards like Bane and Catalyst. The large amount of Poison makes Corpse Explosion a particularly strong setup for the latter.\n\n\n【Trivia[]】\n\nThis card is most likely a reference to the Diablo II Necromancer Corpse Explosion ability; in addition to have the exact same name, the mechanics of the card are also the same (deal damage to other enemies based on the health of the target)\n\n\n【Update History[]】\n\n- Weekly Patch 51: Recursion\nAdding beta art for Bane, Charge Battery, Fission, Choke, Corpse Explosion, and Equilibrium.\nFixed Corpse Explosion card's portrait using incorrect card type.\n- Adding beta art for Bane, Charge Battery, Fission, Choke, Corpse Explosion, and Equilibrium.\n- Fixed Corpse Explosion card's portrait using incorrect card type.\n- Weekly Patch 35: Aggregate\nCorpse Explosion power is now a debuff.\n- Corpse Explosion power is now a debuff.\n- Weekly Patch 33: Terror\nCorpse Explosion power can now trigger on Darklings.\nUpdating Power icon for Corpse Explosion.\n- Corpse Explosion power can now trigger on Darklings.\n- Updating Power icon for Corpse Explosion.\n- Weekly Patch 32: Face Trader\nRework: Corpse Explosion card: Apply 6 Poison.

It deals an impressive 50 damage to all enemies, and costs no Energy, but it can only be played if your Draw Pile is empty. This makes it very difficult to use effectively, or at all.\n\nUpon upgrade it deals an additional 10 damage to every enemy.\n\n\n【Strategy[]】\n\nYou should never take Grand Finale unless you have a way to keep cards between turns, either from Well-Laid Plans or  Runic Pyramid. This lets you keep Grand Finale in your hand until you reach the bottom of your draw pile. However, you will still need to carefully manage the number of cards in your draw pile using cards with extra draw, to ensure that you have exactly 0 cards at some point during your turn.\n\nAlternatively, if your deck is small enough that you can reliably draw the entire deck every turn, you can play this card every turn (possibly more than once per turn).\n\nAssuming you have a deck which can reliably play Grand Finale, it will be more effective the smaller your deck. In a deck which shuffles every 2-3 turns it could easily serve as your primary offense.\n\nAct 3 onward has enemies which need 2 or more uses of Grand Finale at times to kill them, especially more with bosses. Nightmare can allow for much quicker damage in longer fights if used correctly.\n\n\n【Update History[]】\n\n- Patch V1.1: The Dealer\nGrand Finale card is now 0.3s faster in Fast Mode.\n- Grand Finale card is now 0.3s faster in Fast Mode.\n- Weekly Patch 46: Adrenaline\nGrand Finale card buff: 40 -> 50 damage.

Without a Weak enemy, it's an even less effective Strike. In the best case, it's a slightly stronger Flash of Steel.\n\nTo make the most of Heel Hook, ensure that at least one enemy can remain consistently  Weak, and use a small deck to increase the chances of chaining one Heel Hook into another.\n\nGenerally, you should look for more powerful and consistent Attacks instead of picking Heel Hook.\n\nHeel Hook can be built around to make an infinite deck.\n\n\n【Synergies[]】\n\nHeel Hook obviously needs many cards that inflict  Weak.\n\nThe card becomes stronger with A Thousand Cuts, Envenom, and other cards that encourage playing many cards each turn.\n\nReducing Heel Hook's cost to 0 using Madness,  Mummified Hand, or similar effect will gain you one Energy, increasing the odds of your being able to play the card you just drew.\n\n\n【Update History[]】\n\n- Patch V2.0: The Watcher\nHeel Hook card now resolves its actions in order of its description.\n- Heel Hook card now resolves its actions in order of its description.\n- Patch V1.1: The Dealer\nHeel Hook+ card buffed. 7 -> 8 damage.\n- Heel Hook+ card buffed. 7 -> 8 damage.\n- Weekly Patch 4: Full speed ahead!\nFixed rare crash for HeelHook card.\n- Fixed rare crash for HeelHook card."}]}

As an X-cost card, it consumes all remaining Energy when played.\n\nStrength Reduction is applied before Weak, and will be negated by  Artifact in that sequence. Enemies with a single Artifact charge will only have Weak applied on them, as Strength Reduction gets negated by the Artifact. 2 or more Artifact charges will completely nullify this card's effect, removing 2 Artifact charges in the process.\n\nUpgrading Malaise increases the  Strength loss and  Weak count by 1. This will trigger even if you play Malaise with 0 Energy remaining, effectively applying 1  Strength Loss and 1  Weak for no cost.\n\n\n【Strategy[]】\n\nMalaise is a deceptively strong card. It has a potential to be the strongest source of permanent Strength reduction. Its  Strength reduction severely punishes the Snake Plant, Hexaghost, and other enemies that rely on multi-strike, low damage attacks. Its  Weak applied can also cripple a hard-hitting enemy for many turns.\n\nThe Silent has access to a number of Energy-increasing cards, which can power Malaise up further.\n\n\n【Synergies[]】\n\n\n【Update History[]】\n\n- Weekly Patch 34: Malaise\nMalaise increased in rarity (Uncommon-Rare).\n- Malaise increased in rarity (Uncommon-Rare).\n- Weekly Patch 10: Quality of Life\nRemoving 'Spend all [R].' from all X-cost cards for consistency.\nFixed bug where cost X cards do not work with energy gain cards if played too fast.\n- Removing 'Spend all [R].' from all X-cost cards for consistency.\n- Fixed bug where cost X cards do not work with energy gain cards if played too fast."}]}

Even though it is a net disadvantage in terms of card quantity, this is only a problem if you are sure you can play every card in your hand most of the time. However, be wary of taking too many copies of Prepared, as multiple uses in a single turn will unnecessarily discard more than is likely necessary.\n\n- Upgrade to Prepared+ as soon as possible. The additional draw lets you see more cards and assemble stronger plays, and the additional discard enables cards like Eviscerate and Tactician more effectively.\n\n\n【Synergies[]】\n\nPrepared is a key component of any discard deck - it draws you closer to the relevant cards, enables them, and lets you discard cards at will, all while leaving your entire Energy reserve available.\n\nPrepared is especially strong with Tactician, Reflex, Sneaky Strike, and Eviscerate, efficiently drawing and enabling them in one move.\n\n\n【Trivia[]】\n\nThe card art shows the same bag from  Bag of Preparation."}]}

Upgrading Sneaky Strike increases the damage dealt from 12 to 16.\n\n\n【Strategy[]】\n\nSneaky Strike is a standard act 1 damage card. It is usually worth it with one two discard effect in addition of the base deck.\n\nMost Silent deck will benefit from the addition of draw manipulation like Acrobatics or Prepared, and Sneaky Strike can be part of the damage solution. At uncommon Eviscerate will usually be preferred as it fills the same role more efficiently.\n\nWhen playing with Sneaky Strike, play slowly and sequence your moves carefully. Accidentally playing Sneaky Strike before your discard enabler can be a fatal mistake.\n\n\n【Synergies[]】\n\nSneaky Strike requires a huge number of discard effects to function, as well as card draw to find it.\n\nTools of the Trade makes this much easier to play, because it guarantees a discard every turn for the remainder of combat. However, it won't help you if you draw Sneaky Strike before (or on the same turn as) the power.\n\nReducing the card's cost with Enlightenment, Madness, or  Snecko Eye makes it generate Energy, enabling very high-tempo plays.\n\nLike 0-cost cards, Sneaky Strike should be accompanied by card draw or expensive cards to make the most of the 'refunded' Energy.\n\nDecks with Calculated Gamble to accelerate draw can sprinkle in Sneaky Strike for a bit of extra damage.\n\n\n【Trivia[]】\n\nEarly in development, Sneaky Strike was named Underhanded Strike, an apt name given the tender spot being pummeled in the card's art.\n\n\n【Update History[]】\n\n- Patch V2.2: Happy Holidays!\nSneaky Strike card buffed.

As a Rare card, All For One can usually be obtained only as a boss reward and at a considerable price from The Merchant.\n\n\n【Strategy[]】\n\n- All For One is a powerhouse in any deck with a significant number of 0-cost cards. Its ability to recover up to ten free cards enables The Defect to unleash a brutal beatdown while developing future plays. Its 10 base damage is merely a bonus.\n\n- Avoid  Velvet Choker at all costs, since it shuts down the 0-cost deck.\n\n- All For One's strength hinges on the number of 0-cost cards in the deck, and how aggressively the player can draw them. When building around All For One, prioritize zero-cost Attacks like Beam Cell, Go for the Eyes and especially Streamline, FTL, and Claw. Pack as much card draw as possible to put them in the discard pile and All For One in the hand.\n\n- After acquiring All For One, keep 150 Gold available to purchase Panache from The Merchant. All For One turns often involve 10 plays or more, which Panache translates into impressive area of effect damage.\n\n- Be aware that All For One doesn't reliably help The Defect defend itself, as Steam Barrier decreases in effectiveness with every play, and the only infinitely replayable Block-granting 0-cost card, Force Field, is a poor fit in the deck. High-Block Skills, especially Auto-Shields, can stretch the single remaining Energy into a solid defense. Energy-granting Boss Relics like  Cursed Key allow the player to mix more Block into big All For One turns.\n\n- Consider adding Recycle and Hologram to a deck with All For One. While normally weak, these cards do a great job at stabilizing the deck. Recycle is especially useful for clearing unused Attacks from the hand to make room for more discarded cards.\nIn addition, Hologram can, with luck, make Snecko fights trivial. If both Hologram and All for One are randomly drawn as 0 cost, it can create an infinite loop of any 0-cost damage card -> All For One -> Hologram to recall All For One.\n- In addition, Hologram can, with luck, make Snecko fights trivial. If both Hologram and All for One are randomly drawn as 0 cost, it can create an infinite loop of any 0-cost damage card -> All For One -> Hologram to recall All For One.\n\n- While Scrape is normally a key part of a 0-cost deck, it can discard All For One. Check the decklist often to avoid an embarrassing misplay.\n\n- All For One checks the cost that appears on the card. Cards decreased to 0 cost by  Confused will be recovered, but cards increased above 0 cost will not. Note that a card retains its cost when discarded, and Confused randomizes the cost when the card is drawn.\n\n- The player's hand can hold a maximum of 10 cards. If the player can't hold every 0-cost card in the discard pile, the recovered cards are selected in the order they are displayed in the discard pile. Note that playing a card immediately removes it from the hand, so All For One itself doesn't count towards the hand limit.\n\n- All For One's power is entirely determined by the cards it will recover.

Upgrading Chaos causes it to Channel two Orbs instead of one.\n\nAs the art suggests, all four Orbs -  Lightning,  Frost,  Dark, and  Plasma - can be Channeled using Chaos.\n\n\n【Strategy[]】\n\nChaos is one of the most efficient sources of Orbs available to The Defect, and the only reusable way to Channel multiple Orbs. If your deck benefits from loading up many Orb slots or doing a lot of , Chaos will rarely disappoint.\n\nIn addition, Chaos is a useful \"duct tape\" card to smooth out any Orb-related deck. For instance, if you picked up a Thunder Strike but can't find a Ball Lightning to power it, a Chaos can serve the same role.\n\nIt's also a cheap, if unreliable, source of  Plasma Orbs. Decks with many X-cost cards can make the most of these Energy windfalls.\n\nThat said, Chaos does introduce some variance. You can't count on it to produce the specific Orb you need, and bad rolls will occasionally end your run. When offered a Chaos, consider the percentage of good or neutral outcomes versus the percentages of \"bricks\".\n\nUpgrading Chaos is highly recommended. Not only does the upgraded card double the effect, it also doubles the odds of getting the Orb you need.\n\n\n【Synergies[]】\n\nChaos has an obvious synergy with Compile Driver. The card draw provides much-needed \"gas\" when Chaos feeds you Plasma Orbs. Note that this increases the variance of the deck, as Compile Driver is significantly weaker if you only have one type of Orb.\n\nThe card works well with both Consume and Capacitor. The former can turn an upgraded Chaos into a guaranteed powered-up Evocation. The latter allows you to stack up more Orbs so you can cast Chaos without prematurely Evoking your Dark Orbs.\n\nChaos becomes extremely powerful with Echo Form, Channeling a whopping four Orbs for just one Energy. It's also a useful source of bulk Orbs to maximize your Biased Cognition.\n\nWhile Chaos doesn't explicitly synergize with Rainbow, the two cards share synergies and coexist nicely.\n\n\n【Hazards[]】\n\nChaos is a terrible choice for  Dark Orb decks. It will often prematurely Evoke a Dark Orb, effectively making it a Curse for most of the game.\n\nThe card is risky but useful in  Frost Orb decks. These builds often aim to stack up enough Frost Orbs to completely neutralize enemy attacks, which Chaos undermines by bumping off Frost Orbs. That said, Chaos does generate 10 block for 1 Energy in these decks, in addition to whatever benefits the Orbs provide.\n\n\n【Update History[]】\n\n- Weekly Patch 27: Hello World\nThis week adds the long anticipated third character into the game!\nA new character with unique mechanics, keywords, and art.\nContent: 75 Cards.\n- This week adds the long anticipated third character into the game!\n- A new character with unique mechanics, keywords, and art.\n- Content: 75 Cards."}]}

For zero Energy, Claw deals an escalating amount of damage that also amps up your other Claw cards. As a common card, Claw can be found as a post-battle reward and be purchased from the Merchant.\n\nUpgrading Claw increases the base damage of the card from 3 to 5.\n\nClaws added to your deck after Claw is played, such as through Discovery, Hello World or an  Attack Potion, do not have their damage increased while they aren't part of your deck.\n\n\n【Strategy[]】\n\n- Claw is a card that wants to be drawn and played as much as possible to stack up huge numbers. However, the support needed to execute this card's potential makes it not ideal for many decks, since a card like Streamline+ fills the niche of Claw without being as hard to pick.\n- To get the most out of Claw, acquire only enough copies as to be drawn consistently as to not interfere with other deck functions such as Block or Card Draw. Consistency is better achieved by removing underperforming cards rather than by adding too many Claws.\n- Upgrading Claw isn't recommended - instead, upgrade your support and draw cards like Skim and Scrape. Playing your non-upgraded Claws more often not only gives you bonus damage, but also deals the damage you've already accumulated.\n- Adding more card draw like Skim, Scrape,  Unceasing Top, will help Claw reach its fullest potential. There are some good colorless card draw cards that also work well with Claw:\nSecret Weapon\nDeep Breath\nMaster of Strategy\nViolence\n- Secret Weapon\n- Deep Breath\n- Master of Strategy\n- Violence\n\n- Replaying a Claw with Hologram and Echo Form helps accelerate claw damage, though these effects may be better reserved for other cards with more powerful effects.\n- Adding Recycle to strip irrelevant cards from the deck allows the consistency of Claw plays to scale over the battle. Adding an  Unceasing Top and exhausting every other card lets The Defect go infinite, though such combos still requires somehow generating block when against many enemies.\n- All for One allows for even more Claws to be played, alongside other potentially important 0-cost cards such as Beam Cell for more damage and  Vulnerable, and/or Steam Barrier for Block, etc.\n\n\n【Update History[]】\n\n- Weekly Patch 50: The Final Act\nClaw card gets VFX.\n- Claw card gets VFX.\n- Weekly Patch 27: Hello World\nThis week adds the long anticipated third character into the game!\nA new character with unique mechanics, keywords, and art.\nContent: 75 Cards.\n- This week adds the long anticipated third character into the game!\n- A new character with unique mechanics, keywords, and art.\n- Content: 75 Cards.\n\n\n【Trivia[]】\n\n- Before release the name of this card was \"Gash\" and was an Uncommon card.\n- It takes 8 plays of Claw+ before a Claw+ outdamages a Streamline+.

As a Rare card, Echo Form is generally obtainable as a Boss reward and at high cost from The Merchant. However, it can rarely drop from an Elite or even a normal Monster.\n\nUpgrading Echo Form causes it to lose the Ethereal keyword.\n\n\n【Card Effect[]】\n\nEcho Form's printed text only loosely explains its behavior.\n\nA more descriptive effect is that Echo Form causes the first card you play each turn to be played twice unless the enemy dies from the first play. In this case the next card will be doubled instead.\n\nThough the doubled card appears to Exhaust, it does not count for any synergies Exhausting normally does.\n\nMultiple stacks of Echo Form will cause more of your cards per turn to be played twice. (Your first card will not be played three or more times). If the first card you play is another Echo Form, you will have three stacks of Echo Form and two more cards this turn will be played twice.\n\n\n【Interactions[]】\n\n\n【Synergy[]】\n\n- Echo Form combines a big effect with a big cost. Three Energy is generally an entire turn, and the card has literally no effect when played. Before the card is upgraded, the player doesn't even get to pick which turn to sacrifice!\n\n- The decision to upgrade Echo Form depends more on whether the card is an integral part of the deck. If so, there's no need to upgrade it as you'll play it as soon as you draw it. If not, deliberately Exhausting Echo Form can be a relevant option in battles that demand efficient plays.\n\n- When your deck contains Echo Form, select paths that offer many Rest Sites and Events.

You used 2 energy, and gain it back when evoked. As for the “interest”, you gain one extra energy at the start of every turn. Sounds great, but it's actually not that good.\nThe reason is that you can't do much in the turn you play Fusion because you have already consumed 2 energy. On the other hand, your energy will likely to be wasted on the turn you evoke the orb, because you can't use it all up. All in all, unless you can control you deck very well, don't use Fusion in most cases.\nIt's usually not worth it to put some of your energy to later use, especially when Fusion and one of your critical cards (Creative AI, Echo Form, etc.) are both on your hand.\n- The reason is that you can't do much in the turn you play Fusion because you have already consumed 2 energy.

It becomes an agile card which allows spending your extra energy for later and brings almost immediate profit.\n\n\n【Trivia[]】\n\nAs seen in this picture art,  Plasma Orbs seem to be made of a fusion of the three other Orbs, Lightning, Frost and Dark.\n\n\n【Update History[]】\n\n- Weekly Patch 47: Metamorphosis\nFusion card works better for modders now\n- Fusion card works better for modders now\n- Weekly Patch 27: Hello World\nThis week adds the long anticipated third character into the game!\nA new character with unique mechanics, keywords, and art.\nContent: 75 Cards.\n- This week adds the long anticipated third character into the game!\n- A new character with unique mechanics, keywords, and art.\n- Content: 75 Cards."}]}

Luckily, high-Block enemies are particularly annoying, and it's a solid beatstick against the others.\n\n- Melter excels against the Spheric Guardian, effectively dealing 50 or more damage and setting up an easy turn-one kill. It also rips through the abilities of Shelled Parasite and Snake Plant, and punishes Monsters with armor-granting abilities like Darkling, Centurion, and most Minions. It beats The Guardian up immediately after it transforms, and speeds up the Donu and Deca final battle.\n\n- Melter destroys  Block before inflicting its damage, meaning it will deal damage directly to Health.\n\n- Players will almost never encounter multiple high-shield enemies at once, making redundant copies of Melter unnecessary in small decks.\n\n- As a solid standalone utility card, Melter is an oddity among The Defect's highly synergistic card pool. Its effect can translate into a big burst of damage, making it play nicely with efficient, aggressive cards like Hyperbeam.\n\n- The armor-removing effect is not a Debuff, so Melter will not trigger Sadistic Nature and is not nullified by  Artifact.\n\n\n【Trivia[]】\n\nMelter's art depicts what the card does best - melting a Spheric Guardian.\n\n\n【Update History[]】\n\n- Weekly Patch 27: Hello World\nThis week adds the long anticipated third character into the game!\nA new character with unique mechanics, keywords, and art.\nContent: 75 Cards.\n- This week adds the long anticipated third character into the game!\n- A new character with unique mechanics, keywords, and art.\n- Content: 75 Cards."}]}

The payoff is worth the effort - big damage, up to 3 Evokes, and six Energy to play with the following turn.\n\n- Taking Meteor Strike without high-powered Energy generation can be risky. However, since Energy-generating cards are far more common than Meteor Strike, it is not unreasonable to take Meteor Strike and then immediately start looking for such cards. Keep an eye out for cards like Fusion, Aggregate, Double Energy, and Energy-generating Boss Relics like  Cursed Key.\n\n- Since Meteor Strike provides no defense, expect to take some damage the first time it's played. Subsequent plays will actually generate Energy, since remaining Plasma Orbs will probably be Evoked.\n\n- Plasma Orbs consistently generate Energy each turn, so Meteor Strike stabilizes a single-turn Energy boost like Double Energy into an Energy advantage that can last through the rest of the battle.\n\n- Meteor Strike obviously requires Energy generation. Relics are best, but in practice, a combination of Relics and Skills will probably be necessary. TURBO is actually a good choice, as the Plasma Orbs offset Void's Energy loss.\n\n- Subsequent Meteor Strikes will likely Evoke some Plasma Orbs and refund their own costs. Add Skim and Machine Learning to keep the combo going.\n\n- Playing Meteor Strike with an active Echo Form is frankly ridiculous.\n\n- One of Meteor Strike's strongest synergies is Tempest. Tempest Evokes the Plasma orbs, enabling a 12-Energy turn. Meteor Strike then Evokes the Lightning Orbs, dealing 45 total damage and restoring the Plasma.\n\n- Because Plasma Orbs aren't affected by  Focus, consider playing Meteor Strike alongside Hyperbeam.\n\n- Snecko Eye can reduce Meteor Strike's cost enough to play without Energy generation. Snecko Eye will also never make a card cost more than 3, making the combo pure upside.\n- If played as a non-defect character (with 1 empty orb slot) it will cost 5 energy and refund 4 from evokes for a net loss of 1 energy.\n\n\n【Update History[]】\n\n- Weekly Patch 28: The Ritual\nFixed issue where Strike (blue), Thunder Strike, and Meteor Strike weren't used by Perfected Strike.\n- Fixed issue where Strike (blue), Thunder Strike, and Meteor Strike weren't used by Perfected Strike.\n- Weekly Patch 27: Hello World\nThis week adds the long anticipated third character into the game!\nA new character with unique mechanics, keywords, and art.\nContent: 75 Cards.\n- This week adds the long anticipated third character into the game!\n- A new character with unique mechanics, keywords, and art.\n- Content: 75 Cards."}]}

As a common card, Rebound is often offered as a post-battle reward and can be purchased inexpensively from The Merchant.\n\nUpgrading Rebound increases its damage from 9 to 12.\n\n\n【Strategy[]】\n\n- It's easy to accidentally draw the Rebounded card with zero energy left, or to Rebound the wrong card. Carefully sequence the turn, anticipating next turn's draws and enemy Intents, to squeeze the most power out of Rebound's unique effect.\n\n- Take special care to consider your enemies' attack sequences. You don't want to draw a fifth attack card when you really need to  Block, or a defensive card if the enemy is  Vulnerable.\n\n- If you just want to play Rebound for damage and don't need to place any cards on your deck, simply make it your final play before ending your turn.\n\n- Upgrading Rebound marginally increases its power level and is not recommended.\n\n- Rebound's effect speeds up the progression of Streamline and Claw, and can help combine Amplify with a Power card.

This can be used to enable effects like  Sundial.\n\n- Scrape's effect is much stronger than it initially appears. You can immediately play every card you draw, even if you played Scrape with your final Energy.\n\n- You don't even need many 0-cost cards to get value from Scrape — upgrading your starting Zap and Dualcast reduces their costs to 0, and even two Claws can become exceptionally powerful during a long game.\n\n- Be sure to check upgrades while building around Scrape. Many of The Defect's cards drop to 0 cost when upgraded.\n\n- Scrape is one of the few Attacks that can actually draw cards. This makes it useful against Chosen, Gremlin Nob, and other enemies that punish non-Attack cards.\n\n- Be careful not to inadvertently draw Dazed, Clumsy, or Ascender's Bane with Scrape — they will be discarded instead of Exhausted.\n\n- When you have eight or fewer cards in your deck, check your decklist before playing Scrape. If your remaining cards aren't particularly powerful, you may want to deliberately discard them so you'll reshuffle next turn.\n- As Scrape puts cards that do not cost 0 directly into the discard pile, it can be used to increase the block that Stack grants without having to use any energy on the cards that Scrape drew.\n\n\n【Update History[]】\n\n- Patch V2.2: Happy Holidays!\nScrape card draws 3 -> 4 cards.\nScrape+ card buffed.

The issue with Pray is that it does literally nothing on the turn you cast it, unless you're entering Divinity. Additionally, because you had to draw Pray, then draw the Insight, just to draw 2 cards, the end result is that you didn't draw any cards. This makes Pray one of the worst cards in the game for a normal deck, unless you're incredibly committed to achieving Divinity. However, if you can assemble a small enough deck (less than 9 cards) that can somehow generate a lot of energy, a Pray+ can essentially re-draw itself and an Insight over and over.\n\nUltimately, one of the best ways to consider Divinity cards is to consider how many cycles through your deck it takes to achieve Divinity. For example, a card that gives 3 mantra takes 4 deck cycles to reach Divinity, while a card that gives 4 mantra would take 3 deck cycles. Thus, you should ultimately achieve to have your mantra cards give a total of either 5 or 10 mantra each deck cycle. Devotion and  Damaru can also help with this.

This makes it much better than playing regular Defend cards as well.\n\nUsing Wreath of Flame to increase the damage of this card also increases the Block gained from it. Remember that the effect of Vigor is doubled/tripled when in Wrath/Divinity. It also works well for this reason against  Vulnerable enemies.\n\nThis is an excellent card for tackling enemies with  Thorns, as the Block is received before the retaliation damage.\n\nAvoid using this card against enemies with large amounts of  Block, as you must deal unblocked damage to receive block in return.\n\nIt does not scale with  Dexterity, as the block gained is always equal to the damage dealt.

However, it can allow you to enter Divinity through just two cycles of your deck, meaning Worship can be great as your only mantra-generating card. However, having this card be upgraded (which gives it Retain) is critical, as it means that it can be cast on turns where you have the energy, while also allowing you to enter Divinity at the perfect moment. Finally, if you're running Omniscience, choosing Worship allows you to instantly enter Divinity, and costs 0 energy if Omniscience is upgraded, which is an incredibly powerful combo.\n\nUltimately, one of the best ways to consider Divinity cards is to consider how many cycles through your deck it takes to achieve Divinity. For example, a card that gives 3 mantra takes 4 deck cycles to reach Divinity, while a card that gives 4 mantra would take 3 deck cycles. Thus, you should ultimately achieve to have your mantra cards give a total of either 5 or 10 mantra each deck cycle. Devotion and  Damaru can also help with this. As an example of a great Divinity deck, a deck with an upgraded Prostrate, a Worship, and a  Damaru can easily achieve 10 Mantra in just 2-3 turns."}]}

This curse cannot be removed from your deck by any means (unless  Necronomicon is removed, possibly by N'loth). When it is exhausted,  Necronomicon will flash and put another one in your hand.\n\n\n【Strategy[]】\n\n- Necronomicurse counts for  Du-Vu Doll.\n- Omamori will negate the Necronomicurse entirely, but only if  Omamori is acquired first.\n- If the Necronomicurse is played with  Blue Candle, it will be returned to your hand after being exhausted; while this means you can't escape the Necronomicurse, you can play it this way as many times as you want, and that interaction can be exploited in a number of ways.\nIt allows you to take arbitrary amounts of damage in one-damage increments, triggering useful on-damage effects like Rupture or Blood for Blood.\nAlternatively, the  Tungsten Rod negates the HP loss, allowing you to keep playing the Curse for free.\nEach play still counts as an exhaust, so it will trigger on-exhaust effects like  Dead Branch, Dark Embrace, and  Charon's Ashes.\nEach one counts as a card played, so it can trigger things like Panache or A Thousand Cuts.\n- It allows you to take arbitrary amounts of damage in one-damage increments, triggering useful on-damage effects like Rupture or Blood for Blood.\n- Alternatively, the  Tungsten Rod negates the HP loss, allowing you to keep playing the Curse for free.\n- Each play still counts as an exhaust, so it will trigger on-exhaust effects like  Dead Branch, Dark Embrace, and  Charon's Ashes.\n- Each one counts as a card played, so it can trigger things like Panache or A Thousand Cuts.\n\n\n【Trivia[]】\n\n- The  Necronomicon is a reference to Evil Dead's Necronomicon Ex-Mortis, which is a reference to the Necronomicon in Lovecraft mythos.\n- Despite  Necronomicon's description, Necronomicurse is scripted to have its existence tied with  Necronomicon. Should  Necronomicon be removed by any means (possibly via N'loth), Necronomicurse will be removed from the deck as well, however, if the curse was copied (by Duplicator or   Dolly's Mirror for example) only one copy will be removed.\n\n\n【Update History[]】\n\n- Weekly Patch 1: The First of Many!\nNecronomicurse no longer shows up on card removal screens (since it cannot be removed).\n- Necronomicurse no longer shows up on card removal screens (since it cannot be removed).\n\n- Curse Cards: Ascender's Bane•Clumsy•Curse of the Bell•Decay•Doubt•Injury•Necronomicurse•Normality•Pain•Parasite•Pride•Regret•Shame•Writhe"}]}

If the player has access to cards that can Discard or Exhaust other cards, such as Purity, Normality is a high-priority target.\n\nDrawing Normality instantly puts it into effect; in other words, if the player has already played three or more cards and draws Normality, they will no longer be able to play cards for their turn.\n\nA Merchant or a Rest Site with the  Peace Pipe should be the player's first priority if they add Normality to their deck.\n\n\n【Hazards[]】\n\nCopies of cards created by Echo Form and cards that are played twice due to cards such as Double Tap will count as played cards. This makes Normality difficult to play around if the player is relying on these types of cards. Using expensive or X-cost cards during a turn can limit the effect of Normality as fewer cards will be played overall.\n\nBlue Candle will not be able to exhaust Normality after three cards have been played, as exhausting Normality this way counts as a play itself. If Normality is drawn and the player has Blue Candle, they should exhaust Normality before they play three cards.\n\nDrawing Normality while having the  Runic Pyramid is almost always fatal, especially during Elite and Boss fights.\n\n\n【Synergies[]】\n\nNormality synergizes well with  Velvet Choker, as Velvet Choker reduces the total number of playable cards per turn to six, lessening Normality's effect. This synergy is very situational, however; consider looking for alternative synergies, as Normality is dangerous.\n\n\n【Sources[]】\n\n- Cursed Key\n- Choosing [I Am Wealthy] during the Mind Bloom event (2 Normalities)\n- Transforming another Curse\n\n\n【Update History[]】\n\n- Patch V1.1: The Dealer\nFixed exploit of playing Normality while already having played 3+ cards.\nFixed Normality card not stopping cards affected by Setup and Forethought.\n- Fixed exploit of playing Normality while already having played 3+ cards.\n- Fixed Normality card not stopping cards affected by Setup and Forethought.\n- Weekly Patch 33: Terror\nNormality card's reminder text no longer uses incorrect wording.\n- Normality card's reminder text no longer uses incorrect wording.\n- Weekly Patch 6: We're Back!\nClarification for Normality.
