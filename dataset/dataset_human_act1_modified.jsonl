Strengths include high burst damage and scaling with Limit Break. Weaknesses are low sustain and reliance on risky plays.  \n\n**Game Plan:**  \n- **Early Fights:** Use Hemokinesis+ and Bloodletting to enable Blood for Blood while managing HP. Whirlwind clears groups.  \n- **Bosses:** Bash for Vulnerable, then spam high-damage attacks. Limit Break scales Strength if drawn early.  \n- **Tactics:** Prioritize upgrading Hemokinesis+ and removing Strikes. Avoid overusing self-harm against high-damage enemies. Save Whirlwind for multi-enemy fights.  \n\n**Refined (100 words):**  \nAggressively leverage self-harm (Hemokinesis+, Bloodletting) to power Blood for Blood and Anger. Use Whirlwind for AoE, Bash for Vulnerable. Limit Break enables late-game scaling. Manage HP carefully; avoid over-committing self-damage in prolonged fights. Upgrade Hemokinesis+ first, remove Strikes when possible. Save Whirlwind for groups. Against bosses, prioritize Strength scaling with Limit Break if drawn early. Weak sustain means favoring fast kills over attrition.
