Since we need to deal damage to multiple enemies, targeting the first enemy (Sentry) with Cold Snap will hit both enemies. This is better than other options like Strike which is single-target, Beam Cell+ though 0-cost but maybe not AOE. So choosing Cold Snap to target first enemy to hit both.\n}\n```\n\nWait, no, I messed up. Let's start fresh. The hand pile has Cold Snap (cost 1, is_target_required True).
