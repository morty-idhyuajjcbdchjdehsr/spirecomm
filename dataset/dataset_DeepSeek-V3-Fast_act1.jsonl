A Strike deals 6 damage, which is enough to kill the first Louse (7 HP - (6 damage - 4 Block) = 5 damage, reducing it to 2 HP, but it has Weakened(1) which reduces its Block by 1, so the calculation is actually 7 HP - (6 damage - 3 Block) = 4 damage, reducing it to 3 HP. Wait, no, Weakened reduces the enemy's attack damage, not Block. So the Block remains 4. 6 damage - 4 Block = 2 damage, reducing it to 5 HP. Hmm, that's not enough to kill. Maybe I should target the second Louse instead, which has 0 Block and 8 HP. 6 damage would reduce it to 2 HP. Neither Strike will kill, but the second Louse is more threatening since it has no Block and will deal 6 damage next turn. Reducing its HP now is better to mitigate future damage.\"\n}\n```"}]}
