[Defend] would give 4 block (modified by +1 dexterity) for 0 cost, which is slightly more useful defensively, but given the zero-cost draw status 'No Draw', playing the skill that would normally be strongest for utility but now just to trigger After Image feels fine. However, Defend offers more immediate survivability against incoming hit from Byrd’s 9 damage, so in reality that would be slightly better defensively.

Shiv is free to play, allowing me to chip down a low HP TorchHead without spending energy, and also grants block from After Image. Since the boss's total incoming damage after my current block is modest but still chip-worthy, eliminating one attacker will help mitigate future turns' pressure. Other 1-cost cards like Defend or Strike could be saved for remaining energy use after all free damage is applied; Survivor may also be useful later for blocking or discarding Decay, but right now progressing toward killing minions is the best choice.\"\n}\n```"}]}
