    "summary": "Crowbot was originally a planned 3rd character. It was located in the game's files as a sprite of a robotic-looking blue robot, similar in design to the Cultist . Fans of the game theorized it would be the third character since it was found, as it seemed to fit the colour order of \"red/green/blue\" that already existed with the Ironclad and the Silent . Crowbot was theorized by the community to have mechanical abilities, a colour scheme of blue, and a large number of powers. In an interview with one of the developers, Crowbot was confirmed to have been the planned third character. It was supposed to have a \"mana\" system to play cards instead of an energy system. During testing, the idea fell flat and the character was scrapped. The developers then began on a \"gunner\" character which eventually led to the Defect. Afterwards, the third Character The Defect was added into the game's Beta branch in an update on April 26, 2018.",

    "title": "Defect",
    "summary": "The Defect is one of four playable characters in Slay the Spire. Once among the like of Orb Walkers and Bronze Automaton as one of many ancient automatons, it has since gained sentience and seeks its way out of the Spire. It attacks foes with a high-tech arsenal, array of Powers , and elemental evocations.\nThe Defect has a unique mechanic, the Orbs . Using cards and Relics, The Defect Channels these elemental spheres into a set of Orb slots, activating their passive effects each turn or Evoking them for a one-time burst. The Defect starts with three Orb slots, though cards and relics can add or consume them. It starts with 75 hp. The Defect's starting Relic is Cracked Core , which Channels 1 Lightning at the start of each combat. It was added to the beta build in Weekly Patch 22: Testing the Third Character during the early access. It was released to the public, along with the game and other two characters on January 23 rd , 2019.",

          "Listed below are the standard synergies that Defect decks build towards, which may give you an idea of direction for your own runs. Some important things to keep in mind:\n",
          "Most of these builds aren't mutually exclusive. Think of each of the archetypes listed below as an engine that you can incorporate into your deck; depending on the situation, you are more than able to adapt or combine multiple of them.",
          "It's important to not \"force\" a particular build from the outset of the game. Build your deck to solve your immediate problems first and foremost, then allow an archetype to come to you organically. The only exception would be if you run into cards or relics in the early-game that are both individually impactful and form the crux of an entire archetype, and such situations are few and far between.",
          "FocusStacking: While Defect's orbs are initially weak, they grow in power significantly once it findsFocus-increasing cards for its Deck. After this, the Defect's game plan shifts to playing all of them as quickly as possible, then becoming incredibly powerful in terms of offense and defense. Generally, the Defect wants a mix of different kinds of orbs; in particular, you should be able to consistently generateLightningandFrost, changing between them to suit the situation at hand.Cards or relics that increaseFocus:Data Diskgives +1 Focus for free, helping you significantly at the start of a battle.Defragmentis your bread-and-butter, and are priority upgrades.Biased Cognitionprovides a large burst of Focus which can help you end hallway fights quickly. Its downside can be negated withOrange Pelletsor blocked by your ownArtifact. Combo this withCore SurgeorClockwork Souvenirto gain permanent Focus with no drawback.Consumeis a more situational Focus gain card as it reduces your orb slots, but it is reusable as it is a Skill and not a Power. It is best if you have theInserterto offset its downside.Cards that generateLightningandFrost:Zap(Zap+ is 0 cost)Ball LightningElectrodynamicsis a very high-impact card against multiple enemies and is generally the Defect's main AoE solve.Cold SnapGlacierCoolheadedprovides card draw while channeling Frost, allowing you to dig for your main cards.Other helpful additions:Capacitorand relics such asInserterandRunic Capacitorgive you more Orb slots to benefit from Focus increasing Orb value.Seeklets you pull your Focus-generating cards immediately out of the Deck.Card draw such asSkimandCompile Drivercan help cycle through your Deck to get Focus into play as soon as possible, especially when combined withEnergygenerators.Fissionis the best of both worlds, providing both card draw and Energy!Force Fieldcan help generateBlockin a pinch.Echo Formcan duplicate yourDefragmentswhich can normally only be played once, or give you multiple Orb casts.Chaos+ can give you a large volume of orbs right away, but be wary of leaving orb generation up to chance against elites or bosses...",
          "FrostTurtle: While runningLightning-only is a risky prospect,Frost-only builds are surprisingly consistent and can thrive even against the true final boss. \nOnce the shields are up, the Defect can devote every Energy to damage while the opposition cannot do anything back to it.Frost Turtle builds requireFocusand orb slot buffs to function. Refer to the Focus Stacking section for more information on these cards and relics.Cards that generateFrostincludeCold Snap,Glacier, andCoolheaded.Cards and relics that generateFocusincludeDefragment,Biased Cognition,Consume, andData Disk.Cards and relics that add orb slots includeCapacitor,Inserter, andRunic Capacitor.Your main priority as you approach endgame should be to find a damage solution for the final bosses, as defense alone might not win you the run.Barrageis one of your best options in this slot-based deck.Blizzardmay seem tempting, but it scales up very slowly, and takes a long time to match Barrage's power. It is still a viable option if you need spread damage.Combine this build withDarkOrb-generating cards and let them build up behind your Frost orbs, unleashing them when the time is right.Other tips and useful additions:Calipersis a run-winning addition to this deck. The Defect will often have leftoverBlockwith a full setup, which this relic allows to snowball out of control.For orb slots, 2 copies ofCapacitorshould suffice, but you can take more if you want.Take as manyDefragmentas possible, and upgrade as many of them as you can. Focus is even more crucial for this deck as 1 Focus means 1 additionalBlockper channeled Frost orb.SinceCapacitorandDefragmentare not expensive,Mummified Handhas an even greater chance to allow multiple free cards to be played.TheFrozen Coreboss relic fills your orb slots with Frost orbs, which can help you more quickly establish your defenses.Runic Domeis also a powerful boss relic for this Deck, as the extra energy helps get everything into play. You will generally not care about the enemy's action once set up.",
          "LightningSpam: This aggressive build tries to channel and Evoke as manyLightningOrbs as possible, beating enemies down eight damage at a time. Unlike other Orb builds, smaller is better - one Orb slot is optimal to facilitate Evoking.Key cards to this build:Cards that generateLightningincludeZap,Ball Lightning, andElectrodynamics.Electrodynamics is a keySeekorBottled Tornadotarget, letting you start fights against multiple enemies with a massive advantage.If you have a large number of powers,Stormcan add value to those plays by generating even more Lightning.Bullseyebecomes significantly stronger when you're constantly evoking Lightning in the target's direction, amplifying all that damage.Consumedecreases the number of orb slots while increasing Focus. With fewer orb slots, you can rapidly Evoke multiple Lightning Orbs for a large amount of damage.Static Dischargeturns the enemy's offense against them, channeling massive amounts of Lightning against multi-hits in particular.As you are willingly inviting damage to end fights, one or two copies ofSelf Repairare recommended to keep the Defect's health at safe levels.Thunder StrikeandTempestare this deck's premier finishers, dumping huge volumes of damage onto the enemy.Energygeneration from cards likeAggregate,TURBO, orDouble Energythus helps this build quite a bit.Other considerations:Have aBlockplan in mind, as you will gain much less value fromFrostif you are constantly Evoking everything. For example, if you are supportingTempestwith Energy generators, you can useReinforced Bodyas well to defend yourself from huge hits.This build benefits greatly from damage mitigation relics such asToriiorTungsten Rod, especially in conjunction withStatic Discharge. When combined, they can completely nullify damage from almost all multi-hits.",
          "DarkOrb Engine: Even though the trickyDarkOrbs aren't as well-supported as the others and don't always fit into typical builds, the satisfaction of Evoking a highly charged Dark Orb twice (or more!) makes it all worthwhile to try.Cards and relics that generate Dark Orbs:Darknessis your mainDarkOrb generator. When upgraded, it powers up all Dark Orbs in play by one charge.Doom and Gloomis a solid spread damage option that happens to generate a Dark Orb. This card is what usually fits into a normal build as an early-game option, but gets to shine a lot more here.Symbiotic Virusgenerates a free Dark Orb at the start of each combat.Key parts of a Dark Orb engine:Recursionis arguably the most important card for Dark Orbs. This is because if you Evoke a Dark Orb with Recursion, it will immediately channel again with the same stats. If you have a Dark Orb in front but don't want to give it up quite yet, Recursion will move it to the back while dealing a huge chunk of damage in the process, letting you continue building its power.DualcastandMulti-Castwill unleash the Dark Orb multiple times onto enemies, usually ending the fight with a sufficient charge.If running Multi-Cast, you will want to support it withEnergygenerating cards likeAggregate,TURBO, orDouble Energy.Other considerations:Keep in mind that the Dark orb will target the lowest health enemy.This engine works well withFrostdecks, as Frost Orbs help generateBlockand allow you to stall the fight until you are ready to Evoke a Dark Orb.Be extremely careful when fighting enemies with the ability to gainIntangible(namelyNemesis), as evoking a Dark orb at the wrong time will result in the target taking only 1 damage and the accumulated charges being wasted as a result.",
          "Zero Cost: The Defect has a high number of strong 0-cost cards, as well as unique supporting cards likeScrapeandAll for Oneand efficient card-draw Skills. Drown an enemy underFTLs,Claws, andBeam Cells. It's sort of like the Silent'sShivbuilds, but way more back-loaded and visually impressive.Damage comes from 0-cost cards that do damage:ClawFTLBeam CellGo for the EyesStreamline- requires 2 plays (of 2- and 1-cost respectively) before it reaches 0 cost.Dualcast+Zap+The Deck then also needs a lot of recycle/card-draw effects to get as many of the 0-cost cards in play per turn. The Defect has a lot of great support cards for this type of deck:All for One- the best one for this deck as it allows you to re-play all of your 0-cost cards you've played in your deck up until that pointRebound- allows you to double-play cards likeStreamlineandClawto more quickly ramp up their effects.Hologram- reuseAll for One, double-playStreamline, or replay a 0-cost card.Scrape- good card draw that let's you immediately play any 0-cost cards it finds.White Noise+ - when upgraded it becomes a free power.Reboot- very good if you already have the core engine of your deck in place.Seek- great for findingClaw, or even better,All for One.There are also some extremely useful neutral cards that either help get 0-cost cards, or are 0-cost cards themselves (or both):Madness- can be difficult to get, but if you are able to acquire it, it will greatly speed up your deck by turning your strongest cards into 0-cost cards.2Madness+ withAll for OneandHologram+ is an infinite. Use both madness to reduceAll for OneandHologram+ to 0-cost, and use each one to put the other back into your hand.Seek+ makes this easier to pull off. Double Seek+ is even easier, as it allows for 3 of the 4 cards to be put into your hand immediately.Bottled Lightningalso makes this easier to pull off.Swift StrikeSecret Technique+/Secret Weapon+ - both of these when upgraded will allow you to get your key cards faster.Panache- as you will almost certainly be playing more than 5 cards every turn, this will be a guaranteed 10 damage to all enemies every turn.Thinking Ahead- upgrade this ASAP so that you can reuse it.ViolenceMetamorphosisPurity- can get rid of Strikes/Defends during combat, which, depending on the state of your deck, may allow you to go infinite.J.A.X.- a rare card as it only comes from theAugmenterevent, but any source of strength is a huge benefit for a deck that aims to play many 0-cost attacks every turn. As an added bonus, the card itself costs 0 and so, if you have the health for it, can quickly ramp up your damage to high levels in this deck.",
          "Power Spam: The Ironclad likes Attacks, the Silent loves Skills, and the Defect completes the cycle with its affinity for Powers. Grab high-impact powers likeEcho Form, pick up someForce Fields, stack powerful effects, and bury the opposition under your cumulative advantage. While most Defect builds pick and choose the most appropriate Powers for their deck, this one will eventually have the benefits of them all. There is nothing quite like being able to double your first 6 cards played per turn with 10+Focusand a horde ofLightningorbs staring down any boss that dares stand in your way.Refine the deck by using Powers to fill the roles of Attacks and Skills. ConsiderStatic DischargeandStormyour primary sources of damage, andBufferandSelf Repairyour biggest blockers. A Power spam deck's win condition depends on the particular Powers you acquire. Most builds will create a huge amount ofLightning, but others simply lean onCreative AIand let the buffs snowball out of control.Key cards and relics for this build:Stormallows the deck to maintain offensive presence while setting up. Upgrade it as soon as you identify that your deck is leaning into Power spam.Creative AIallows Power spam decks to scale to infinity without ever losing steam, synergizing amazingly with itself and all of the other Power-synergy cards that The Defect can get.Heatsinksis what makes a Power spam deck tick. It will allow you to blaze through your deck to find key Powers orEnergygeneration likeAggregate,TURBO, orDouble Energy, which is critical to setting up before you take too much damage.Recycle+ can delete useless powers thatCreative AIgenerates, such asHello Worldor extra copies of Creative AI, and helps keep your deck size thin in longer fights.Force Fieldis your mainBlocksupplement; it is essentially guaranteed to be at 0 cost due to how this deck functions.Amplify, while a bit inconsistent, can provide a huge power spike depending on which Power is duplicated. Good targets for Amplify are cards likeDefragmentandCapacitor. If you choose to run it, support it with cards likeHologramandEquilibriumwhich can get it into your hand at the perfect time.Mummified Handis essentially a game-ender in this build. Being able to chain Powers and potentially play your entire hand for free is simply too good to pass up.TheBird-Faced Urnis the perfect relic to recover HP lost while setting up.",
          "Reprogram: A deck that repeatedly playsReprogramto rapidly scale up yourStrengthandDexterity, ignoringFocusand Orbs entirely. If you find yourself with a conspicuous lack of Focus deep into the run, Reprogram can give your deck a strong win condition. It is important that you do not force a Reprogram deck, as committing to it too early can completely lock you out of half of Defect's card pool.Key cards and relics:Reprogramis the star of the show. Upgrade it as soon as possible, and you'll gain +2StrengthandDexterityevery time you cycle through your deck. You only really need one copy, and cards likeSeekorSkimcan help you get to it faster.A few copies ofHologram+ let you reuseReprogram, repeatedly playSteam Barrierin an emergency, or recover copies of each other, scaling up your Block as needed. Your high Dexterity will easily make up for Hologram's low Block.Echo Formallows you to double-play Reprogram at the start of the turn. Double-playing damage or block cards also compensates for the fact that Defect doesn't have many cards (aside from the unreliableRip and Tear) that scale multiple times with Strength or Dexterity.Hyperbeamdeals massive AoE damage, and you can ignore its only downside.Steam Barrieralso effectively loses its downside, since you'll be gaining Dexterity faster than Steam Barrier loses Block.All for Onestrategies fit well with this deck, since spammable 0-costs likeClawandBeam Cellscale well with high Strength. It can also recover yourSteam Barrier.Plasmagenerators likeFusion+ andNuclear Batteryare good options, since Plasma Orbs don't scale with Focus.Prismatic Shard, while usually unreliable, is a surprisingly good relic to pick up when you have Reprogram. Other characters' damage cards scale much better with Strength and Dexterity, letting you better take advantage of the boosts.Reprogram can also shine in a hybrid build. If you find yourself with lots of Orbs but no Focus, the following cards coupled with Reprogram can help speed your Deck up:Fissionallows you to get one last burst of value out of your Orbs by speeding through your Deck, letting you get Reprogram into circulation or finding your Echo Form earlier to begin the snowballing process.Barrageconditionally scales multiple times with Reprogram's Strength boost. If you have some Plasma generation or still have copies of damage commons such asCold SnaporBall Lightningin your Deck that are generating useless Orbs, consider picking this up to still be able to capitalize on their presence.",
          "Snecko EyeAbuse: The Defect has incredible synergy with theSnecko Eyedue to the very large pool of high-impact cards it has.The Defect has several extremely powerful but expensive cards likeFusion,Echo Form,Sunder, andMeteor Strike. By takingSnecko Eyeearly enough, you can focus exclusively on taking these cards for absurdly high-value turns. Many of these effects will generate more energy than they spend.In particular,Meteor Strikewill never cost more than 3 Energy, allowing you to always play it. Evoking thePlasmaOrbs it generates can also allow you to play more high-rolled cards, which somewhat negates the drawback of Snecko Eye.All for Oneis completely broken with Snecko Eye. Since cards will retain their cost until you draw them again, it will fetch everything that was decremented to 0 cost, even cards that would normally be quite expensive. A 0-cost All for One paired with a 0-costHologram(which is also a good card in this build for similar reasons) is an easy infinite.Skim,Compile Driver,Coolheaded+, andOverclockcan provide large amounts of card draw, which is a premium in Snecko decks.Most of the Defect's 0-cost cards are dead weight in this archetype, so it is important to home in on it as early as possible. If you don't getSnecko EyefromNeowor the first boss, pick a different strategy.",
          "10 Card Infinite: With this build, the defect is capable of going infinite against most opponents.Getting the deck down to 10 cards allows for setting up 4 card infinite cycles withSkimand negative cost cards.Fusion,Meteor Strike,TURBO(withRecycle),Recursion,Dualcastcan combine in various ways to get negative cost.Hologramor a secondSkimcan be used to restart the cycle.Example set:Skim+,Hologram+,Fusion+,Dualcast+. Skim draws Hologram, Fusion and Dual Cast, Fusion and Dual Cast make net 2 energy, Hologram retrieves Skim. Nets 1 energy and 5 block, can substitute any attacks in for Fusion and Dual Cast after energy is built up.2Coolheaded+ andFusion+ can make infinite block, and channel an arbitrary number of Frost orbs forBlizzard.It is important to only take cards that are either Powers, Exhaust, or are directly part of the combo while building the deck, since the goal is to get the total number of cards down under 10. Recycle can handle junk put in the deck and help thin it out if its not quite down to 10 cards.Boot Sequenceis very helpful as a free method of preventing damage during the first turn while the infinite combo is being set up while exhausting itself out of the deck to help enable the combo."

          "High DefenseDeck: This strategy focuses on building upBlockover multiple turns, potentially eliminating incoming damage.Plated Armoris an excellent fit in this build.Essential cards includeBody Slam,Entrench, andBarricade.Barricademay be substituted byCalipers, provided that you have a consistentBlockper turn.Keep in mind thatBarricade+ costs 2 energy and won't instantly boost your damage/block, so playing it may weaken you on the turn played.Body SlamandJuggernautare excellent sources of damage, which is still important to win.Though not an intuitive choice,Second Windcan be used to thin out extraneousBlockcards once enoughBlockis built up, letting the player more reliably draw attacks and rely onEntrenchto maintain theirBlock.Strengthreduction fromDisarmandWeakfromIntimidate,Clothesline, andUppercutcan help reduce enemies' attack damage, allowing you to maintain yourBlock.",
          "High StrengthDeck: Spot Weakness,Flex,Limit Break,Demon Form, andInflameare cards that offerStrength.A helpful tip withFlex, in particular, is that if you have anArtifactbefore you useFlex, or trigger the effect ofOrange Pelletsafter usingFlex, you won't lose theStrengthgained from it on the next turn. This givesFlexgood synergy with sources ofArtifacts, such asClockwork SouvenirorPanacea.Limit Breakalso allows you to benefit permanently from temporary strength effects such asFlex.Whirlwind/Heavy Blade,Sword Boomerang,Twin Strike, etc. are all cards that synergize well withStrength.This build focuses on increasingStrengthand multiplying its power through the choice of attacks. Attacks that hit multiple creatures, or hit multiple times scale more effectively withStrength.Reaperbecomes a very powerful healing tool with highStrength, especially when paired with aMagic Flower.Vulnerabilitycards such asBash,Trip, andThunderclapwork very well with the high damaging attacks offered to you with highStrength.IfLimit Breakis upgraded, you can cast it multiple times for exponential strength gain.Headbuttand a small deck size help you cast it more often.

          "Searing BlowDeck: UpgradeSearing Blowevery opportunity you can. Its damage increases more with each upgrade, reaching 100+ damage after ten upgrades.Vulnerableis extremely good in aSearing Blowdeck, as when upgraded a lot the extra damage can easily reach 40-50+The deck should be kept small to cycle back toSearing Blowas often as possible.If you decide to go for aSearing Blowdeck, you should always take the path that gives you the most campfiresMost must-upgrade cards become less valuable, as their upgrade is taking away fromSearing Blow'spower.You generally only want to aim for aSearing Blowdeck if you meet the following criteria:You get it early in Act I (preferably before your first campfire)You have a path that can take you through at least 3+ campfires in Act ICard synergies:Headbuttlet you play it an extra time each deck cycleDual Wieldgives you additional copies if you manage to get it in the same hand asSearing Blow.If you getDual Wieldin a Searing Blow deck, you should prioritize cards that help you find the combo:Secret Weapon+ is probably the best one in bringingSearing Blowto your hand.Violenceis also good if your deck is small and you don't have many Attacks remaining.Runic Pyramidwill ensure that you get the combo at some point.All exhaust cards can be very good at thinning your deck during combat.Double Taplet yourSearing Blowdeal double damageArmaments- can continually ramp up yourSearing Blowdamage during combatRelic synergies:Warped Tongswill continually upgrade yourSearing Blowover time during combat.Wing Bootsallows you to take additional campfires that you normally won't be able to get to.Necronomicondoubles the damage ofSearing Blowevery time you play it.Pen Nib- double damage ofSearing Blowbut requires some planning to execute.Paper Phroghas a minor synergy but at higherSearing Blowlevels the increase of damage from this relic is significant.Dolly's Mirror- if you get this after you have upgraded your Searing Blow a few times, it will effectively double the strength of the deck.",

IfDead Branchgenerates another Skill, then you can use another Skill again for free.Most of Ironclad Skills grant highBlock, allow you to easily tank damage once you use multiple of them.

WithCorruption, it becomes a free 2Energygeneration.

          "Corruption+Dark EmbraceDeck: Unlike the normalexhaustionand defense strategies above (which focus on building up power over time), your goal here is to try and make your deck almost entirely out of skills, get outCorruptionandDark Embracetogether, then burn through your entire deck in one turn to raise your defense, with doubling effects fromEntrenchplayed last, finally followed by one or moreBody Slamsto kill the enemy in one hit.The essential cards areCorruption,Dark Embrace,Entrench, andBody Slam, plus cards likeImpervious,Shrug It Off, andSentinelto build defense before you double it withEntrench. Provided you keep your deck overwhelmingly tilted towards skills and fill it with lots of card draw, you should only need to drawCorruptionandDark Embracebefore you start comboing off; the rest of the combo will be found as you draw your deck. Multiple copies ofEntrenchorBody Slam(or things that duplicate them) are still extremely valuable; you also want to upgradeCorruption,Dark Embrace, andBody Slamto reduce the cost of the combo so you can deploy it faster.It's also important to have cards that let you dig for your combo, such asShrug It Off,Burning Pact, andOffering.

Each defensive skill played is worth an additional 10-14 damage.Iron Wavesare good fallbacks.Removals should focus on getting rid of yourStrikesrather than yourDefends; while yourDefendsaren't as good as your otherBlockcards, they can still be cycled through for free once you haveCorruptionandDark Embraceout.",

          "The Silent's starting deck is the largest of the 4 characters, at 12 cards, compared to the Ironclad's, Defect's and Watcher's starting deck, each of which have 10 cards. This means more Strikes and Defends are encountered in Act 1, and it's slightly more difficult to remove all starting cards from The Silent's Deck. The Silent's starting deck is also the cheapest, with its 2 non-Strike non-Defend cards costing 1 and 0. This means it's easier to take strong 2-cost card options earlier in the game, such as Dash, Predator, and Leg Sweep.\n",
          "Her starting Relic,  Ring of the Snake, ensures that the first turn of every fight is slightly stronger than all of the other turns. This makes Innate cards slightly better for Silent, since they only take up 1 of 7 cards instead of 1 of 5 cards. The \"Bottle Relics\" ( Bottled Flame,  Bottled Lightning, and  Bottled Tornado) have improved utility for similar reasons.\n",
          "Owing to these properties, the Silent's early-game performance is by far the weakest out of the four characters. Her lack of upfront damage leaves her ill-equipped to deal with Act 1 Elite encounters, particularly the Lagavulin and Gremlin Nob, if players do not fix the damage density of her starting deck. Thus, even getting a run started can be a challenge with the Silent, particularly on high Ascension levels. However, if players can overcome this hurdle, they will realize Silent's incredible late-game potential, where her performance is conversely the strongest on average. Her access to the strongest damage mitigation tools in the game, as well as consistent long-term scaling damage and card manipulation, make even decks that seem weak able to clear the Act 3 boss gauntlet and even the Corrupt Heart with correct play.\n"

        "Synergies": [
          "Listed below are the standard synergies that Silent decks build towards, which may give you an idea of direction for your own runs. Some important things to keep in mind:\n",
          "Most of these builds aren't mutually exclusive. Think of each of the archetypes listed below as an engine that you can incorporate into your deck; depending on the situation, you are more than able to adapt or combine multiple of them.",
          "It's important to not \"force\" a particular build from the outset of the game. Build your deck to solve your immediate problems first and foremost, then allow an archetype to come to you organically. The only exception would be if you run into cards or relics in the early-game that are both individually impactful and form the crux of an entire archetype, and such situations are few and far between.",
          "Cards that are generally good in any Silent strategy include:\n",
          "Well-Laid Plans. The ability to hold key cards for when you need them most is amazing, and part of why Silent is so strong into the late-game. You can hold that crucial Burst + Catalyst for when you've stacked up a critical mass of  Poison, Wraith Form for an enemy's biggest hits, etc. Even outside of these examples, simply holding over damage or block on a turn where you don't need either one quite yet can let you answer whatever the enemy throws at you.",
          "Alchemize. Potions are an incredibly strong resource in Slay the Spire, especially as you climb the Ascension levels, owing to their ability to be deployed whenever you need them, or saved for crucial fights. A card that provides more of this resource thus makes every deck stronger.",
          "Discard& Draw: WhilePoisonandShivsynergies usually capture the attention of newSpireplayers, Silent's biggest strength is arguably her card manipulation, much of which owes to her ability to cycle through the deck effortlessly. Herdiscardand card draw effects are thus the bread-and-butter of many of the strongest Silent decks, allowing unparalleled consistency in executing the deck's win condition.Cards that provide card draw:Acrobaticsis Silent's main cycling tool, allowing you to see 3 (4) new cards from your deck at a low cost, and even allows you to trigger discard synergies, all on a Common!Tools of the Tradeallows you to see an extra card every turn.Backflipdraws 2 while providing a small amount ofBlock. If your late-game Block plan involves stackingDexterity, this can provide an incredible amount of incidental Block for you while you look for your key cards.Preparedis nothing special unupgraded, as it merely replaces itself. However, Prepared+ is a very strong tool that allows you to dig further through your deck for free.Calculated Gambleallows you to see an entire new hand, and when upgraded, no longer Exhausts, meaning you can do this every cycle.Expertiseis by far the weakest out of Silent's card draw tools, as it is conditional, and she wants to keep a large hand anyway. However, if you have no other sources of draw that increase your hand size, it will do in a pinch.Cards that benefit off discards:Eviscerateis a premium frontloaded damage option for a deck that cycles a lot. It will frequently cost nothing and slam an enemy for a good chunk of damage, and synergizes well with any source ofStrengthor evenWrist Bladeif fully discounted.Sneaky Strikerefunds itself if you've discarded anything during the turn. By itself, it's a decent damage button for the early-game that retains some value later on. Later on, if you find any way to discount it (such as with the otherwise nicheSetup), it can even become anEnergygenerator!Concentrategives a huge burst ofEnergyfor decks that have a surplus of draw but not enough Energy generation. It becomes absolutely broken withRunic Pyramid, as you will almost be guaranteed to have a full hand, and Concentrate will make hand space for you to continue your turn.Tacticiangrants 1 (2)Energywhen discarded. If your deck can reliably discardTactician, then it has a steady supply ofEnergy, which makes most of your turns much more efficient. With a small enough deck, you can actually guarantee discardingTacticianmultiple times, which can become infinite.Reflexdraws 2 (3) cards when discarded. While not as crucial in a deck with a lot of Backflips and Acrobatics, it still has a strong place in Silent's kit. A fully upgradedReflexcombined withPrepared, upgradedCalculated Gamble, and a small deck can go infinite.While Silent's card draw power is usually in service of her other synergies, discard can occasionally be a win condition all by itself. The aforementioned infinites are one aveune for that, but these are some others:Tingsha/Tough Bandagesdeals 3 damage / grants 3 block on each discard. If you can get these relics, you can simply spam discard to fight for you without even having to play output cards!Phantasmal Killercan be your entire damage solve, as if you cycle enough, you can end up playing it on every single turn, removing the need to line it up carefully. Slamming the enemy with double damage Eviscerates and Sneaky Strikes can sometimes be enough even in the absence of traditional scaling.Grand Finale, while often niche, has its best showing in particularly discard- and draw-heavy decks, especially if you haveRunic Pyramid. Because you can control how much you draw every turn, with enough careful planning, you can get the Finale off with reasonable consistency.",
          "Poison: PoisonBuilds usePoisonstacks as their main source of damage. With the right cards, you can ramp upPoisonstacks on an enemy very quickly and kill them in 1-2 turns. However, the usual style ofPoisonbuilds slowly ramp up stacks over time and whittle the enemy down over many turns.Noxious Fumes, on its own, will gradually build up more and more poison until the enemy dies. It allows many builds to play much more defensively, and stall out fights with full-defense turns, as they are passively dealing more and more damage. Synergizes amazingly withBlockBuilds. However, this playstyle struggles with enemies that scale by buffing their own strength.Malaiseis a great addition to aFumesbuild.Poisoned Stabis a decent damage source on its own, which becomes better when you have aPoisondeck and can reliably stackPoison.Catalyst, if you're able to play it multiple times, can exponentially increasePoisonto ridiculous levels in a single turn. WithNightmareorBurst(or both), you get extra plays out of yourCatalyst, which can quickly stack up hundreds ofPoison. This build has incredible single-target damage, but is very bad at damaging multiple targets (withoutThe Specimen), and requires a decent supply of draw/energy. Very good for all single-target encounters, and becomes worse the more enemies there are.AveragePoisoncards are not that great on their own, and only become stronger if you already have aPoisondeck built around them.BaneDeadly PoisonBouncing FlaskCrippling CloudEnvenomaddsPoisononto all of your attack cards. Works extremely well if you are able to play many attack cards in a turn. Synergizes well with cheap attacks likeEndless Agony, multiple-hit attacks likeRiddle with Holes,Finisher, andEviscerate, and pretty much allShiv-generating cards.Corpse Explosioncould help solve the lack of AoE damage ofPoison.Snecko Skullis very strong for poison decks; it simply just gives more poison to your existing poison cards. You get the best value from this using poison sources that give small stacks of poison at a time: namely,Noxious FumesandEnvenom. It also works well withBouncing Flask, since it applies poison multiple times.The Specimengives poison decks much-needed multi-target damage. This is a must-have if you encounter this relic and have committed to making a poison deck.",
          "ShivDeck: A primarily damage-focused build that revolves around gaining and using manyShivsduring each combat. The Silent also has a fewRelicsthat are specifically for enhancing Shivs.Infinite Blades,Cloak and Dagger, andBlade Danceare absolute musts for the archetype. All addShivsto your hand. Amplified by strength cards and relics (i.e.J.A.X.,Shuriken,Kunai,Ornamental Fan). Don't forget to upgradeInfinite Bladesfirst so it appears innately in your hand.Wrist Bladeamplifies not onlyShivsbut Silent's other 0 energy attacks, such asSliceandBackstab. 0 energy attacks also have great synergy withChokeandA Thousand Cuts.Ninja Scrollcan quickly jump start your first turn every combat.Accuracyamplifies your shivs. The more, the better. Beware ofThe Awakened One.EnvenomappliesPoisonwhile you attack with barrages ofShivs. Couple with theSnecko Skullrelic for easy clears.Sadistic Naturealso combines extremely effectively with it; thePoisonfromEnvenomwill trigger the damage fromSadistic Nature. This strategy can serve as a bridge betweenPoisonandShivbuilds in case you end up with a mix of cards and relics suitable for each.Storm of Steelcan be a great finisher if you haveEnvenom.A couple ofAfter Imagesgive you great survivability due to card-spamming nature of this archetype.After unloading all yourShivs,Finisheradds free damage.Dead Branch-Shivswhen played, and so benefit from relics that trigger on card .Anchoris useful for surviving while setting up your combo since your initial setup will take up most of your energy (Infinite Blades,After Image,A Thousand Cuts, etc.)A Thousand Cutsprovides a good AoE damage for this deck.Chokeoffers strong single-target damage in aShivdeck. Also, sinceChokecauses the target to lose life instead of taking damage, it bypasses enemyBlock.Expertiseis very good for refilling your hand after playing your low-costShiv/Slice/Endless Agonycards.Since you will be playing a lot ofShiv, which is anAttack, you will trigger relics likeOrnamental Fan,Nunchaku,Kunai, andShurikenmany times.Shiv decks struggle againstTime Eater(because shiv decks rely on playing large volumes of cards) andCorrupt Heart(because of Beat of Death), so have a plan to account for those.Envenomcan help by adding passive damage to each shiv.Tungsten Rodcan mitigate Beat of Death entirely if the run is at low enough Ascension or if the player hasToriias well.",
          "DexterityStacking +WeakChain: Silent's baseBlocknumbers are quite low, but her access toDexteritythroughFootwork, her ability to play many cards per turn, and her many cards that can keepWeakonto enemies, all prop up how low those numbers are. This can be a powerful late-game defense solution as the package is quite lightweight, yet can stall out combats effectively until the deck's main damage engine comes online.Sources ofDexterity:Footwork, which gives you 2 (3)Dexterityfor the rest of the combat. One or two copies can be enough, but it never hurts to include more — as many as you're able to without harming the consistency of your first cycle through the deck.Kunai, which gives you 1Dexterityevery time you play 3 Attacks in a single turn. This synergizes beautifully withShiv-generating cards, which basically turn into Dexterity generators while also dealing damage. If you find this relic early and lean into Shivs, you might not even need Footworks!Cloak and Daggerbecomes particularly good with this relic.Sources ofWeak:Neutralize+Sucker Punch+Crippling Cloudis AoEWeakthat can mitigate a large amount of damage while providing somePoisonticks.Leg Sweepis a card that provides bothWeakandBlockat the same time. It doesn't benefit as much fromDexteritydue to its high cost, but excels in stopping single-target damage.Block cards that benefit most from the accumulatedDexterity:Backflipis not only a good draw card but, as mentioned in the previous section, can incidentally generate lots ofBlockwhile helping you cycle if you have ample Dexterity.Deflectgoes from being relatively low-impact to potentially blocking for double-digit numbers for 0Energyonce you've put all the Footworks down, making it a good inclusion, particularly if you have lots of draw to find it consistently.Dodge and Rollscales withDexteritytwice, and gets extra value when you know you will be attacked every turn.Bluris very good at stackingBlockover multiple turns if you find yourself frequently overblocking. However, it's not as consistent asIronclad'sBarricadeat doing so, since it only lasts one turn. You need to use it wisely or have multiple copies of Blur if you are reliant on this for critical turns in the endgame.Other considerations:Burstis another strong card, as it basically doubles theBlockof your nextBlockcard (ortwowhen upgraded!) It goes very well with all the aboveBlockcards, especiallyDodge and RollandBlur, and is generally a strong card for turning on your damage engine as well.BaseDefendcards are actually quite strong with these types of synergies, and shouldn't be removed from the deck. If you identify that this will be your main defense solve, consider taking[Simplicity]atAncient Writingto upgrade them to bolster your base numbers even further. It's also one of the clearest applications of acceptingMark of the Bloomby taking[I Am Awake]atMind Bloom, because it will also upgrade all of the otherBlockcards you've added to your deck alongside any Footworks that haven't been upgraded, which can result in you taking no damage for the rest of the run.Paper Kraneamplifies the effectiveness of yourWeakfrom 25% to 40%. Due to how rounding inSpireworks, this can mitigate a lot more damage than you expect, so definitely take advantage of this relic if you find it.",
          "Non-DexterityMitigation: The Silent also has a bevy of damage mitigation options to choose from that don't involveDexterity.Piercing Wailis perhaps the best example of this. It's a Common card that takes away 6 (8)Strengthfrom enemies for that turn — it completely shuts down multi-hits, notably completely blocking theCorrupt Heart's Blood Shots all the way into thethirdcycle, and can control multi-enemy encounters, all for just 1Energy. For multi-stage boss fights such as theAwakened OneorTime Eater, playing Piercing Wail on the turn they \"reset\" (before you kill the first phase of the Awakened One, or on the turn that Time Eater clears debuffs and heals back to half) will cause them to permanently lose that much Strength. Every deck benefits from at least a few copies of Piercing Wail.Malaiseis one of the strongest cards in Silent's card pool, being able to not only keepWeakon an enemy but also permanently reduce theirStrength, neutering multi-hits in the process. It is one of the very best solutions toTime Eaterin particular, and can buy enough time forShivstrategies to scale without fearing giving the boss too muchStrength.After Imageis a very goodBlockcard with huge value throughout every combat. For 1Energy, you get usually at least 4-5 block every turn for the rest of combat. It synergizes very well with card-generation cards and 0-Energycards, and goes particularly well intoShivstrategies.Wraith Formis one of the most powerful individual cards in the game, giving youIntangiblefor 2 (3) turns. Often times, this is enough time to straight-up end hallway fights because you can now focus all of yourEnergyon attacking without much fear of taking damage. If you have multiple copies of Wraith Form or a way to duplicate it (such as withNightmare),After Imageto block chip damage, orOrange Pelletsto erase theDexterity-down debuff, you can even ignore its downside completely. OnAscension19 and 20, it also lowers theCorrupt Heart'sBeat of Deathdamage down from 2 or 3 to 1.Other considerations:Nightmarecan be a difficult card to pick, but with enough card manipulation and the correct targets (most of which are defensive), it can provide an out to every fight in the game. It is best with cards listed in this section, such as Malaise, After Image, and Wraith Form, as they all become significantly stronger in multiples. However, it can also be used to duplicateFootworkas well, in case you don't have enough for a particular fight. Two copies of Nightmare (one used to duplicate the other) can allow you to duplicate cards indefinitely, so long as you have theEnergyfor it. Nightmare can also duplicateAlchemizeto increase your chances of finding strong Potions, most notablyGhost in a Jarwhich is a free turn ofIntangible."

This is what makes the Watcher such a powerful class - she has almost complete control of her Energy flow, being able to extract as much value out of every point as possible by either bursting down enemies, or banking Energy for a future turn. Ensure that you are building and playing such that you can fully take advantage of the value the stances provide.Also strongly consider taking some of the following:Meditateis one of the best cards in this Deck, allowing you to end the turn in Calm as well as set up your next turn perfectly by recycling key cards. It also pairs excellently withRetainsynergies if you choose to run cards such asEstablishmentandSands of Time.Simmering Furyis a good one-two punch withMeditateand gives you massive setup potential, especially if you haveRushdown- you can basically fill up your entire hand for the next turn!Flurry of Blowskeeps your offense going as you switch stances and can help quickly put an end to hallway fights.Mental Fortressbecomes almost mandatory in this Deck as the bestBlockplan available. Many non-infinite stance Decks take multiples of this card to ensure they never have issues blocking in the late-game.Talk to the Handis also excellent, especially withTantrumandFlurry of Blows, but can struggle against foes withArtifact.Haltis also an excellent Block supplement and even scales multiple times withDexterityif you have a source of it.The \"Empty\" cards (Empty Body,Empty Fist, andEmpty Mind) are excellent in this Deck, and count as stance changes to triggerMental FortressandFlurry of Blows.In larger Decks,TranquilityandCrescendoare decent picks for theirRetain, letting you enter either stance at will (and for free when upgraded) on critical turns where you can't dig towards your reusable changers.",
          "StanceDance (Infinite): The Watcher is notorious among some players for having consistent and easy access to this infinite. Once the infinite is achieved, the Watcher can demolish everything in her way up to theCorrupt Heartwith little difficulty.The key components to the infinite are the following:A 1-cost, reusableWrathentry (Eruption+,Tantrum, orIndignation);A 1-cost, reusableCalmentry (Inner PeaceorFear No Evil) or aVigilancewithViolet Lotus;At least 1 copy ofRushdown;Card draw to put your entire Deck in your hand (most commonly withScrawlorEmpty Mind).For the infinite, it's important to keep your deck as small as possible. If leaving yourself open to this build, do not take too many cards early on; one or two good damage cards to beat the first few Elites is enough.The game plan with the Stance Dance infinite is simply to putRushdowninto play, then put your entire Deck in your hand. Then, enter Calm, and immediately exit to Wrath. Rushdown will redraw both cards you just played, and you will have lost noEnergy, as Calm refunds 2 Energy while it took 2 to play both cards. Repeat this process until the fight is over.While this infinite is incredibly powerful and solves almost every fight in the game once established, it's important to be prepared for the few fights that can put a stop to this strategy. You must also take care during the transitional period between getting all of the pieces and slimming your Deck down enough to execute the infinite on turn 1.Mental Fortressshould be an auto-include if you are going up against the Corrupt Heart orTime Eater. These are the only two fights that will force you to generateBlock. With enough stance dancing, you will blank all of their attacks, even if you cannot kill them in one turn.Talk to the Handwill also suffice, but will not generate as much Block per cycle, especially against the Time Eater.Runic Pyramidhas several uses in this build, most notably to ensure that you can execute the infinite against the Heart or Time Eater every turn. It also aids greatly if your Deck is still slightly too large to execute the infinite on turn 1. If you must spend your first turn playing your Powers or cards that Exhaust to slim down the Deck, Runic Pyramid helps you keep everything in your hand so that you are ready to go infinite the next turn.Peace Pipecan be an absolute godsend in this build, allowing you to be several card removals ahead of the curve. You will only need to upgrade a few key cards, so the opportunity cost of Toking once those upgrades are done will be essentially nonexistent. For similar reasons, findingSmiling Maskshould also push you towards this build.",
          "Mantra/Divinity: Divinitystance is to the Watcher asDarkOrbs are to theDefect. They aren't usually part of the character's core strategy, but the payoff for making them work is second to none.Upon entering Divinity through generating 10Mantra, the Watcher gains 3Energyand tripled damage, but the stance only lasts until the end of the turn. A successful Mantra strategy will thus look for ways to accelerate both its active and passive generation to consistently enter Divinity at the right times without sustaining too much damage beforehand. Afterwards, it should strive to extend each Divinity turn as much as possible.Key cards and considerations in this build:Devotioncan be an nice inclusion to this build, though it must be upgraded. Devotion is unfortunately very slow, but in longer fights (such as boss fights), it can be very powerful. It stacks very well with itself, and if you can somehow put 3 of these into play, you can enter Divinity every turn with ease.Prostrateis one of the best active Mantra generators, as getting the free block on cast can make this a fine pick in the early game. However, the low amount of Mantra given (2, or 3 when upgraded) means that it's very difficult to enter Divinity off of just Prostrate alone.Pray, on the other hand, is rarely worth taking. The issue with Pray is that it does literally nothing on the turn you cast it, unless you're entering Divinity. Additionally, because you had to draw Pray, then draw theInsight, just to draw 2 cards, the end result is that you didn't draw any cards. This makes Pray one of the worst cards in the game for a normal deck, unless you're incredibly committed to achieving Divinity. However, if you can assemble a small enough deck (less than 9 cards) that can somehow generate a lot of energy, a Pray+ can essentially re-draw itself and an insight over and over.Worshipcosts 2 energy, and generates 5 Mantra without doing anything else. Unlike Prostrate and Pray+, Worship is energy negative. However, it can allow you to enter Divinity through just two cycles of your deck, meaning Worship can be great as your only mantra-generating card. However, having this card be upgraded (which gives itRetain) is critical, as it means that it can be cast on turns where you have the energy, while also allowing you to enter Divinity at the perfect moment. Finally, if you're runningOmniscience, choosing Worship allows you to instantly enter Divinity, and costs 0 energy if Omniscience is upgraded, which is an incredibly powerful combo.Before entering Divinity, the Watcher should ideally be inCalm- this will provide a massive surge of energy and allow you to achieve lethal much more easily. Thus, 1-cost reusable Calm entries such as are strong inclusions, though watch out forFear No Evilcausing you to leave Divinity.After entering Divinity, you will want to make the most use out of the massive surge of Energy - thus, having a large hand is paramount. Any source of card draw, includingWheel Kick,Cut Through Fate,Scrawl, and Insights generated from Pray, are very powerful, as are attacks that retain from previous turns such asSands of Time. Inner Peace can also provide card draw before the entrance.Wallopis also a strong choice for this deck. Divinity solves your damage, but can struggle against fights that force you to defend, which Wallop fixes by providing a huge burst ofBlockwhile barely easing up on the offense.Damarucan be a solid boost to Mantra generation if you can find it. It often can reduce the amount of turns it takes to achieve divinity by one. However, the relic is pretty useless without any other divinity cards.Other notes:Do not useBlasphemy, as it is counterproductive to what the deck is already doing.Fastingis a great option as it gives you a burst ofStrengthandDexterity. The latter is especially important as it will boost the blocking power ofProstrateand ensure you have no issues defending, especially against the Corrupt Heart. Once everything is set up, you will generate so much Energy that it offsets the loss from Fasting. However, it does make the early stages of the fight much more precarious, unless you haveOrange Pellets.Brillianceis strong if you have a thin Deck with not a lot of attacks, as it can scale essentially unbounded and be a one-card damage solve. However, be wary of situations where Brilliance becomes a \"win-more\" card - Divinity offers plenty of damage already, so you may be set with what you already have.Ultimately, one of the best ways to consider Divinity cards is to consider how many cycles through your deck it takes to achieve Divinity. For example, a card that gives 3 mantra takes 4 deck cycles to reach Divinity, while a card that gives 4 mantra would take 3 deck cycles. Thus, you should ultimately achieve to have your mantra cards give a total of either 5 or 10 mantra each deck cycle.DevotionandDamarucan also help with this. As an example of a great Divinity deck, a deck with an upgradedProstrate, aWorship, and aDamarucan easily achieve 10 Mantra in just 2-3 turns.",
          "RetainBuild: This build is primarily defensive, and wants to utilizeEstablishmentto lower the cost of your cards and build up to one incredibly powerful turn once costs are reduced and cards are powered up. This deck is going to be lower on attacks and heavy on skills.Establishment- This is your best card. If you find it early, grab it and upgrade it the first chance you can get. Upgrading gives itInnate, meaning you will always draw it and only need one.Sands of Time- Your best attack card. WithEstablishment, it will be free in two turns. It is leagues more powerful thanWindmill Strikein your average Watcher deck, as it can sit in your hand for a few turns, then be a free (or very cheap) 40 damage after casting Eruption. Picking up a Sands of Time early in Act 1 is often what gets you into the Retain build.Windmill Strike- Your other attack card. This can sit in your hand and have its cost reduced thanks toEstablishment, followed by aStancechange to Wrath, likely killing your target. However, it takes 4 turns to become better than Sands of Time, resulting in it usually being worse.Meditate- This card combos withEstablishmentas well, since the two cards will be reduced as soon you pick them up. This will reduce the cost of any card you pick up, even if they don't haveRetain. As well, going intoCalmcan help end a big turn.You can set up a variety of infinites on small deck if you reduce cost of reusable cycling/draw cards, e.g.Inner Peace,Cut Through Fate.Crescendo/Tranquility- It is preferable to have at least one of each in your deck. No need to upgrade them if you haveEstablishment, since they will cost 0 one turn later.Spirit Shield- It's rare, but the best defensive card for this build, especially because you will have many cards in your hand. Upgrade this if you can, though it is optional to do so.Scrawl- This allows you to fill up your hand, picking up severalRetaincards.Cut Through Fate- This is a great card regardless of your build. It is preferable to have one to help smooth out card draws.Perseverance/Protect/Flying Sleeves- Your most simple cards. You'll likely want at least one of each defensive card, hopefully twoProtectsif you can find them.Of note, a couple ofScrycards can be useful. This helps filter out curses, andThird Eyecan still be useful even if it isn't aRetaincard.Just Luckyalone isn't enough for this purpose.",
          "RagnarokBuild: ARagnarokdeck focuses on keeping a thin deck with a way to defend yourself until you get the perfect turn to unleash a buffed attack hopefully killing anything in your way. It helps to get the card fairly early, but a lot of Wrath-based decks can include it efficiently.Ragnarok- The namesake of this deck, this card scales extremely well with theWrathstance as well as several other cards. Upgrading it is a must.Wreath of Flame- On an unupgradedRagnarok, a singleWreath of Flamewill add an additional 25 damage to the attack. Stacking this card is very important for the burst attack.Blasphemy- This card is very powerful for any burst damage decks, triple damage and 2Energywith in practice no downsides if you can finish the fight that turn. The upgraded version lets you retain this card for the right moment when you'll drawRagnarok.Crush Jointsand/orTrip- Combining the vulnerable debuff on top of a wrath or divinity stance andWreath of Flameshould kill most enemy or boss in one cast of ragnarok. An upgradedTripis especially useful if usingRagnarokas AOE on a group of enemies and to removeArtifactstacks.Deus Ex Machina- Saving theMiraclesgiven by this card will allow you to buff yourRagnarokeven more by allowing you to play moreWreath of Flame.Third Eye- Gives you survivability while also allowing you to prune your draws just the way you like them.Scrawl- Upgraded, this card lets you fill up your hand with potentially moreWreath of Flameswithout losing anyEnergy.Fasting- Gives yourRagnarokmore damage, however sacrifices some energy. Good if you get an early energy relic and can reliably drawDeus Ex Machina.",
          "ScryBuild: Scryenables you to refine what you draw, and cards such asWeaveandNirvanacan turnScryinginto a powerful action. Similar in play-style to the Flurry Stance deck, doesn't need to be kept thin at all due to theScrying, which can go through large decks quickly.Weave- Similar toFlurry of Blows, you will want as many of these as possible, as you can return them all to your hand multiple times per turn. When Scrying, these should always be discarded, since they will immediately return themselves to your hand.Nirvana- Rewards you withBlockuponscrying. Serves a similar function toMental Fortressbut for aScrydeck; if you have many of them, you can chain up large amounts of block effortlessly. Upgrade priority.Foresight- The best card to have at least 1 of for this deck. Every turn you triggerNirvanaand get to play everyWeaveagain. Upgrading it/obtaining additional copies won't trigger this more than once, however it will allow you to fine tune your draw more carefully, and throw moreWeavesinto the discard pile.Cut Through Fate- A distinctly powerful card that not only grants you aScry, but draws a card. The card draw is valuable for getting those Scry-curated cards from the top of your deck into your hand.Just Lucky- Brilliant utility card for this deck, since the scry amount matters far less than the act of scrying itself. Returning every Weave to your hand for free is the primary use of this coin.Third Eye- Solid card with a scry effect. In case it isn't obvious, you want as many cards that scry as possible.Talk to the Hand- Just as with the Stance Dancer deck, attacking with numerous small attacks makes this card a fantastic addition to the deck, and can even enable you to safely remain inWrathif you so desire.",
          "Pressure Points: Relying onPressure Pointsand not much else, the strategy is to limit your deck size to be as small as possible, while having as manyPressure Pointsas possible. Potent against single enemies but falters against groups andArtifact.Pressure Points- the focal point of the deck, get as many as possible and upgrade where possible.Calm- Due toPressure Pointsnot gaining a buff from being inWrath, there's not much motivation to exitCalm. Considers picking cards that help entering, or capitalize on remaining inCalmInner Peace- Helps you draw morePressure Pointsand cycle your deck faster while inCalm.Like Water- Grants quite potentBlockwhile you remains inCalm. Get as many as you can find to bolster this deck defensive nature.Meditate- Apart from enteringCalm, it can return one or twoPressure Pointsthat you have played to your hand. If you have this card, consider pickingEstablishmentto help reduce the cost of cards thatMeditatereturns from discard pile.ExitingCalmmay also be used to gain resources in a pinch. To avoid doubling enemy attack damage, consider cards such asEmpty Fist,Empty Body, andEmpty Mind. The last two are especially effective in this deck as it grantsBlockand card draw, respectively.Sanctity- As you rely onPressure Points, aSkillcard, to deal damage,Sanctitywill almost always help you draw additional cards and cycle your deck faster.Wave of the Hand- Can help strippingArtifactoff from enemies so thatPressure Pointscan apply its debuff and deal damage.Deus Ex Machina- Due toPressure Pointscosting 1, resources will continuously be your limiting factor. Anything that allows you to gain extra resources is a blessing.Signature Move- BecausePressure Points, this deck's primary offense, is counted as aSkill, you will be able to play this card far more often.",
          "Creation: The Watcher has more cards that create other cards than any other character. This strategy aims to make the most of flooding your hand with powerful, mostly one-use cards.Master Reality- The cornerstone of this deck, Master Reality makes every created card much more useful. Once upgraded, it costs zero energy to use.Battle Hymn/Study- Aggro powers that create useful cards every turn that crucially retain, enabling you to keep them until the perfect moment.Deceive Reality/Evaluate- Defensive skills that create useful, self-retaining cards.Spirit Shield- Insight and retain cards can quickly and reliably max out your hand, greatly augmenting the potential of this block.Conjure Blade- This is a potential game winner, if connected to enough energy. This entire deck can be focused down to defending until you can produce a powerful enough Expunger, and then wiping the floor with that.Deus Ex Machina/Vault/Blasphemy- Aside fromDeva Formand various relics, these cards are your best bets for generating the energy necessary to make the most of this deck.Establishment- Since most created cards retain, this card give you much more value from them.",
          "Alpha: Alpha is a card which requires a lot of investment within fights (you have to draw 3 cards and play 6 mana just for it to work), but has a really awesome pay-off if you can pull it off. Generally Alpha decks work best when they are small and contain a lot of supporting block cards. Creating an alpha deck is a popular way to complete the minimalist achievement, as you essentially only need alpha combined with a few block cards to win the game.Alpha- The backbone of this deck. Alpha shuffles a Beta into your deck.Beta- Beta shuffles Omega into your deck. This isn't a card you can pick up (unfortunately) but is rather something that is generated during fights.Omega- Omega is aPowerthat, once played, will deal 50 damage to all enemies at the end of your turn. It is worth noting that it will deal the 50 damageEVERYturn. The damage is not affected byWrathstance orDivinity. Omega quickly clears hallway fights and elites - however, you may need to continue blocking for a few turns to finish bosses off.Omniscience- Omniscience really shines in this deck. For 3 (or 4) mana you can essentially rip Omega right out of your deck and play it twice. That is 100 damageper turn.If you are in a really sticky situation it can sometimes be worth playing Omniscience on Beta to ensure that you will draw Omega next turn, but this is generally not advised.Third Eye- This card gives you both block and scry, things that this deck really needs. Block is so you can live long enough to play Omega and scry so you can make sure that you draw it.Deceive Reality/Evaluate- Whilst these aren't quite as good as third eye, they both work towards the blocking/surviving objective.Sanctity- You need to be careful playing this card. It gives you block and draws cards at the same time which in theory are very good things for this deck. Also, your deck should be full of mainly skills cards so you shouldn't have any trouble triggering its secondary effect. However, if you play sanctity without enough mana to play the next stage of your alpha combo, you could be doing yourself a major disservice.For example: you start the game with 3 mana. If you play alpha, then sanctity you only have 1 mana left. If sanctity draws Beta it then gets stuck in your discard pile.Duplication Potion- Omega's best friend. Similar to Omniscience but in potion form.Miraclesources such asDeus Ex MachinaandCollectcan be used to lessen the cost of Omega on the turn you cast it."

        "In general, it is best to focus on killing any Sneaky Gremlins first, followed by Fat Gremlins, then Shield Gremlins, and finally Mad Gremlins. If a Gremlin Wizard is present, start focusing on him as soon as is necessary to kill him before he uses Ultimate Blast.\nSneaky Gremlins deal the most direct damage, and should be dealt with on the first turn if possible, before they can be protected by a Shield Gremlin and before a Fat Gremlin can weaken you.\nFat Gremlins apply  Weak, which can make killing the other gremlins more difficult, so they should often be dealt with next.\nShield Gremlins will only deal damage to you if they have no allies left to protect. Thus, it is good to kill them after the high priority targets have been dealt with, but before every other gremlin has been killed. You may need to adjust your priorities based on which gremlins the Shield Gremlin chooses to protect. It may be good to attack the Shield Gremlin first if a Gremlin Wizard is present, as the Shield Gremlin may interfere with killing the Gremlin Wizard quickly.\nAngry Gremlins do the least damage initially, but their damage will increase as you attack them. Thus, it is best to  Block their attacks for the first few rounds until you can afford to focus on them and kill them quickly.\nGremlin Wizards are a bit trickier to deal with. While they only attack once every three turns, their damage can be difficult to  Block in Act 1. Ideally, you should kill them before they get a chance to use Ultimate Blast, which may require focusing on them before other lower priority gremlins.",

As with most heavy-hitters,  Weak can be a very powerful asset to buy you more time. The  Weak Potion is also effective as the three  Weak will lessen damage every single turn, and the Orb Walker always attacks.\n",

Since most  Block-granting cards are also Skills, it can be worth more to not play them and take the damage instead. Before using a Skill to mitigate damage, consider how much longer the fight might take.\nWith the Ironclad's Basic deck, the fight is about being as aggressive as possible until the very end. Use Bash to apply  Vulnerable as much as possible, and play every Strike attack you're dealt. When you feel the Nob will only have one turn left to live, it can be beneficial to play a Defend versus a  Skull Bash.  Burning Blood will absorb some of the impact of the fight at the end.\nWith the Silent's Basic deck, the fight becomes more painful. The objective, however, does not change. Neutralize helps to mitigate some of the damage. Taking 4 or 10 damage should be much more manageable. Otherwise, lay in with Strikes whenever possible.\nWith the Defect's Basic deck the fight plays out similar to the Silent. Despite the strength gain it may be worth it to cast Zap early in the fight (especially if you traded away your  starting relic) and Dualcast late in the fight. Dualcast often lets you finish him off a whole turn earlier, making the strength gain irrelevant.\nWith the Watcher's Basic deck, focus on maintaining aggression and play strong offensive cards. It is usually worth to take damage as the Watcher's style of gameplay can deal excessive amounts of damage in a single turn. Playing cards which enable Wrath or Divinity such as Eruption or Blasphemy to deal a large amount of burst damage can easily finish off the Gremlin Nob.\nPowers and Potions can both be effective at mitigating damage in place of Skills.",

If your deck heavily relies on these strategies in Act 3, the fight may be more difficult than normal.\n",
        "Kill the Cultists as soon as possible as they gain  Strength each turn after the first. The Awakened One itself is straightforward to handle: match your defense to the specific attack and use the rest of your energy to deal damage. Once you lower it to 0 HP, it will become invulnerable until its next turn while removing debuffs like weakened and vulnerable. Use that turn to ramp up your defense and possibly play power cards that were saved, since The Awakened One will immediately use its Dark Echo attack. Surviving Phase 2 is mostly a matter of surviving Dark Echo -- especially the first one, which could catch unsuspecting characters off-guard. Save any exhaust cards that will help speed up this phase (e.g. Terror).\n",
        "Watch out for Phase 1's Curiosity ability. Whenever you play a Power, the Awakened One will gain 1  Strength (2 in Ascension 19+). This is especially dangerous with the Soul Strike attack, which will use the  Strength bonus four times. Even if you have a Power build, you might want to avoid using them during this phase. Curiosity goes away in Phase 2, so you might want to spam your Powers when the Awakened One enters its invulnerable state between the phases, or as soon as Phase 2 begins.\n",
        "Use temporary  Strength debuffs (like Piercing Wail) right before killing his first form. The debuff will permanently lower  Strength in Phase 2, but not below 0.\n"

Evidence to support this theory includes the the humanoid hands and body shape of the Awakened One, the name \"Chosen\", and the blue feathers that appear to be growing out of the body of the Chosen (in contrast to the Cultists, who appear to be only wearing clothes that mimic feathers). There is also the Ritual Dagger, which was used by worshippers of the deity in The Nest event, signaling that the body that houses the Awakened One was stabbed on purpose as part of a cult ritual.",

This can be relevant if the Awakened One is the first Boss fought in Act 3 on Ascension 20, or if the player will continue to Act 4.

    "title": "Bosses",
    "summary": "Bosses are incredibly difficult monsters that are encountered at the end of each Act. Compared to both normal monsters and elites , bosses typically sport a much higher health pool, much more damaging attacks, and utilize special gimmicks that either heavily cripple the player's deck or considerably buff themselves. Every boss has a unique portrait visible at the top of the Spire map, which can help plan a deck accordingly. The preceding map location will always be a Rest Site , allowing the player to heal before the fight; the only exception to this is the Corrupt Heart in Act 4 which always has a special elite encounter before it. One boss is fought at the end of each Act. To advance to the next Act, the boss must successfully be defeated. At the end of Act 3 , two bosses are fought in a row at Ascension 20. Upon defeating the Act 1 and Act 2 bosses, the player is rewarded with gold , a choice between three rare cards , a choice between three boss relics , and occasionally, a random potion . The Act 3 and Act 4 bosses do not award the player any consumables or cards. The player is also healed to full health ( 75% of missing health starting at Ascension 5) at the end of every boss battle. Slaying a boss will add 50 points to a run's score . Slaying a boss without taking damage, not including self-damaging cards such as Offering , adds an additional 50 points. Slaying all three bosses without taking any damage adds 200 points and overrides any previous flawlessness bonus. Some relics will activate during boss fights:  Pantograph will heal the player for 25 HP at the start of each boss combat.  Slaver's Collar will give the player an additional Energy at the start of their turn. Conversely, relics such as the Wing Boots cannot be used to skip boss fights, as all paths in an Act lead to the floor that contains the boss. During the Mind Bloom Event in Act 3 , choosing the [I Am War] option starts a fight with a random Act 1 boss for a random rare relic . This boss fight does not add towards the run's score, but does activate the Pantograph and Slaver's Collar relics. The Act 4 boss cannot be fought on the first playthrough of any character minus the Watcher . To fight the Act 4 boss, the player must defeat the Act 3 boss with the Ironclad , the Silent , and the Defect at least once.",

Because of its Invincible buff, it can only take 300 (200) damage per turn, rendering strategies that rely on heavy damage less effective. Additionally, it will gain incredible amounts of Strength on its fourth buff and onward, so killing it quickly is also important.",

Furthermore, their plated armor grants them a deceptive amount of HP over the course of the fight, while their initial Artifact charges grant them a degree of resistance against powerful cards like Bash and Piercing Wail.\n",
        "Most of the time, you should choose one of the two bosses to focus down before moving on to the other. Decks that cannot out-block the scaling damage from Circle of Power should typically kill Donu as quickly as possible. On the other hand, the Dazes that Deca shuffles into the discard pile can vastly slow down your draw as the fight wears on, particularly for decks lacking in card draw. These decks may prefer to kill Deca first.\n"

Since Haste erases all debuffs and heals the Time Eater back to half HP, there is no reason to take offensive action once the Time Eater is below half HP unless you can kill the Time Eater in one turn. It is better to play Powers and buff yourself for the remaining battle when possible.\nDue to the fact that the heal can be reliably activated, it may be worth ending the turn with Time Warp close to 12 if it lets you get the Time Eater below half HP, as you can safely play only one or two cards next turn while he heals, resetting the timer.\nThe heal action will remove the debuffs from Piercing Wail and Dark Shackles and their \"buffs\" (regaining  Strength), causing Time Eater to permanently lose any  Strength it had before.\nThe debuff cleanse from Haste can be challenging for certain decks, such as slow-ramping Poison decks.

As a Common card, it can be found as a reward after combats. Upgrading Perfected Strike increases the damage bonus for each \"Strike\" from 2 to 3. The bonus damage is added to the base damage of the card, and all the damage is dealt in one shot, meaning strength bonuses are applied only once and not multiple times. In combat, the first line of the card's text is updated to reflect the additional damage. Each copy of Perfected Strike counts itself as a \"Strike\". The eligible cards are: Perfected Strike Pommel Strike Strike Twin Strike Wild Strike Swift Strike In game modes where you have access to cards of every color, it additionally counts: The Defect's Strike The Silent's Strike The Watcher's Strike Sneaky Strike Thunder Strike Meteor Strike Windmill Strike",

        "Acrobatics costs 1 energy to draw 3 cards and discard 1 card, thus yielding a net gain of 2 cards (not considering the cost of drawing acrobatics in the first place). Although on the surface it may seem to be no better than a card like Backflip, it synergizes very well with cards whose effects trigger upon being discarded (e.g. Tactician, Reflex), or who have additional effects if other cards have been discarded (e.g. Sneaky Strike, Eviscerate). It also allows you discard Curses, Statuses, or cards that aren't useful on a given turn.\nThe upgrade for Acrobatics is relatively powerful, as it provides a net gain of 3 cards instead of 2. In addition to the obvious benefits of additional card draw, this also means that you have more options for cards to discard.",

        "In general, drawing 3 cards sounds very meritable, but this is usually only true in the later part of the game. Early on, when you only have 3 Energy, it is rarely reasonable to spend 1 energy purely to draw cards, since you still need energy to play the cards that you draw.\nReusable cards that provide energy can help improve the effectiveness of Acrobatics early on. For instance, Concentrate (especially when both it and Acrobatics are upgraded) becomes more viable when you have the additional cards drawn by Acrobatics.",

The key thing to remember is that Bullet Time itself takes up a slot in any hand you draw it into, and does nothing but let you play the remaining cards. Furthermore, unlike with generic energy-gain cards, cards that draw other cards must be played before Bullet Time itself.",
        "If you're just drawing five cards a turn, Bullet Time will let you play four of them; if you already have an Energy relic, and most of your cards cost 1 or 0, Bullet Time will be completely useless (no better than a Curse) every time it's drawn. For it to be useful, the total cost of the other cards worth playing in your hand has to be higher than your Energy limit. In a normal deck that hasn't been intentionally built around it, this happens less frequently than you would expect.\nAlternatively, instead of running a high-cost deck, you must at least ensure you have enough card-draw effects that you can use before Bullet Time consistently, specifically Acrobatics or Backflip. This requires 4 Energy or Bullet Time+. Other draws such as Prepared or Tools of the Trade aren't necessarily sufficient, since they don't give a net positive in the amount of cards you get. Escape Plan only replaces itself and may grant some  Block, but does not increase the number of cards in your hand.",

The Snecko Eye will often reduce Bullet Time's cost below 3 Energy as well, meaning that there may still be spare Energy for drawing more cards before using Bullet Time.",

        "Corpse Explosion is an exceptionally strong card when fighting multiple enemies. Even without the above-average amount of Poison, it can inflict massive amounts of area-of-effect damage and easily clear boards.\n",
        "As a Poison enabler, it's strong but clunky. 9 Poison is the single largest printed amount of Poison, but two Energy is a big investment. Consider it a step up from Bouncing Flask in most situations.\n",
        "A key decision when casting Corpse Explosion is whether to target an enemy with low HP to wipe it off the board earlier, or to target the enemy with the highest max HP to wipe the entire board at once. Generally, targeting the beefiest enemy and then focusing all of your attacks on it is the optimal play, though if a shuffle is imminent, it may be smarter to pick a weaker enemy and try to stack the effect again.\n",
        "Corpse Explosion is an excellent workhorse for defensive decks. The Poison cuts through Block while the explosion scales the damage up, allowing you to fully focus on defense. It also negates up to two  artifacts because of its two effects (poison and apply poison upon death).\n",

If the player can't hold every 0-cost card in the discard pile, the recovered cards are selected in the order they are displayed in the discard pile.

Generally, it's a good card for normal encounters with multiple enemies, and thus it's never too late to get your hands on one. Sunder should be upgraded as soon as possible, because upgrading heightens the “finishing line” to 32, thus allowing higher chances to regain its cost. Trip or Beam Cell can further increase it to 48, which is enough to defeat many monsters in one shot, even in The Beyond.\n"

    "summary": "Pray is, unfortunately, rarely worth taking. The issue with Pray is that it does literally nothing on the turn you cast it, unless you're entering Divinity. Additionally, because you had to draw Pray, then draw the Insight , just to draw 2 cards, the end result is that you didn't draw any cards. This makes Pray one of the worst cards in the game for a normal deck, unless you're incredibly committed to achieving Divinity. However, if you can assemble a small enough deck (less than 9 cards) that can somehow generate a lot of energy, a Pray+ can essentially re-draw itself and an Insight over and over. Ultimately, one of the best ways to consider Divinity cards is to consider how many cycles through your deck it takes to achieve Divinity. For example, a card that gives 3 mantra takes 4 deck cycles to reach Divinity, while a card that gives 4 mantra would take 3 deck cycles. Thus, you should ultimately achieve to have your mantra cards give a total of either 5 or 10 mantra each deck cycle. Devotion and Damaru can also help with this. As an example of a great Divinity deck, a deck with an upgraded Pray , a Worship , and a Damaru can easily achieve 10 Mantra in just 2-3 turns.",

    "title": "Talk to the Hand",
    "summary": "Talk to the Hand is an Uncommon Watcher Attack card. It is a single target hit dealing a modest 5(7) damage which exhausts itself afterwards. However, it applies a debuff to the attacked enemy which returns 2(3) Block to the player on future attacks against that enemy. Since the block return debuff is based on each hit on the debuffed enemy, attacks which hit the debuffed enemy more than once or hit multiple debuffed enemies will give multiple instances of Block . This makes Talk to the Hand an unusual attack which usually serves to defend the player on the played turn and after, more than to deal any meaningful damage. Talk to the Hand works well with multi-hitting cards like Flying Sleeves , Bowling Bash , Tantrum , Ragnarok , or Conjure Blade , as well as hand-returning cards such as Flurry of Blows or Weave . It also allows Wave of the Hand to apply its Weak debuff multiple times for extra defensive power. The block effect, like all debuffs, is blocked by Artifact , and can be removed by bosses, such as The Champ and Time Eater , with debuff clearing actions.",

However, having this card be upgraded (which gives it Retain ) is critical, as it means that it can be cast on turns where you have the energy, while also allowing you to enter Divinity at the perfect moment. Finally, if you're running Omniscience , choosing Worship allows you to instantly enter Divinity, and costs 0 energy if Omniscience is upgraded, which is an incredibly powerful combo. Ultimately, one of the best ways to consider Divinity cards is to consider how many cycles through your deck it takes to achieve Divinity. For example, a card that gives 3 mantra takes 4 deck cycles to reach Divinity, while a card that gives 4 mantra would take 3 deck cycles. Thus, you should ultimately achieve to have your mantra cards give a total of either 5 or 10 mantra each deck cycle. Devotion and Damaru can also help with this. As an example of a great Divinity deck, a deck with an upgraded Prostrate , a Worship , and a Damaru can easily achieve 10 Mantra in just 2-3 turns.",
